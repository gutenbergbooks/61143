<i>These Reflections being
made in the Country, where
the Book that occasion’d
them came but late to Hand, the</i>
Reader <i>is desir’d to excuse their
Unseasonableness as well as other
Faults; and to believe, that they
have no other Design than to Correct
some Abuses, which are not the
less because Power and Prescription
seem to authorize them. If any is
so needlesly curious as to inquire from
what Hand they come, they may
please to know, that it is not good
Manners to ask, since the Title
Page does not tell them: We are all
of us sufficiently Vain, and without
doubt, the celebrated Name of</i> Author,
<i>which most are so fond of, had
not been avoided but for very good
Reasons: To name but one</i>; Who
will care to pull upon themselves
an Hornet’s Nest? <i>’Tis a very great
Fault, to regard rather Who it is
that speaks, than What is spoken;
and either to submit to Authority,
when we should only yield to Reason;
or if Reason press too hard, to
think to ward it off by Personal Objections
and Reflections. Bold Truths
may pass while the Speaker is</i> Incognito,
<i>but are seldom endur’d
when he is known; few Minds being
strong enough to bear what contradicts
their Principles and Practices,
without recriminating when
they can</i>. <i>And though to tell the
Truth be the most Friendly Office,
yet whoever is so hardy as to venture
at it, shall be counted an Enemy
for so doing.</i></p>

Curiosity, which is
sometimes an Occasion of
Good, but more frequently
of Mischief, by disturbing
our own or our Neighbours
Repose, having induc’d me to read
the Account of an unhappy Marriage,
I thought an Afternoon would not be
quite thrown away in pursuing such
<i>Reflections</i> as it occasion’d. I am far
from designing a Satire upon Marriage,
as some pretend, either unkindly or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>ignorantly, through want of <i>Reflection</i>
in that Sense wherein I use the Word.</p>

<p class='c003'>One wou’d have thought that Cardinal
<i>Mazarine</i>, whose Dignity, Power
and Riches, render’d him so considerable
in the Eyes of all <i>Europe</i>; and who,
like most great Ministers, aim’d at nothing
so much as the aggrandizing himself
and his Family, and who wanted
no Opportunities of doing it, should
have taken his Measures so justly as not
to be disappointed: At least, that a Fabrick
rais’d with as much Art and Cost,
founded in the Oppression, and cemented
with the Blood of the People, should
not so quickly have tumbled into the
Dust after him. But so it is, <i>Providence</i>,
whether we think of it or no, overrules
our Actions and baffles our best-concerted
Projects: So that unless we
wilfully shut our Eyes, we cannot but
discern, that when <i>Men in</i> Power and
<i>Honour</i> leave <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>God</span></em> out of their Schemes,
they <i>have no Understanding</i>, though their
natural Genius be ever so bright, <i>but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>are</i> justly <i>compared to the Beasts that perish</i>.
The <i>Ignorant</i> and <i>Foolish</i> succeed
quite as well as the <i>Worldly-wise</i>, who
<i>carry nothing away with them when they</i>
die, neither will their Riches and Glory
descend as they intended. It is only by
generous and worthy Actions that we
are rescued from Oblivion, or from what
is worse, being remembred with Contempt
and Execrations: So little Reason
is there to envy any Man’s Wealth and
Greatness, but much to emulate their
Wisdom and Vertue whose Views extend
to a more durable Felicity.</p>

<p class='c003'>’Tis natural to well-turn’d Minds,
when they hear of any Person eminent
in Wit and Beauty, adorn’d with Politeness
and Address, to wish these may be
accompanied and supported by what is
more valuable and lasting, solid Sense and
real Vertue. One grieves at any Imputation
on such an engaging Character,
and if one cannot always find the favourite
Person fortunate, one labours for
the Consolation of finding them discreet;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>and even where their Conduct is not
wholly blameless, Compassion and Good-nature
will take Place of Censure in a
Noble, as well as in a Christian Heart.
We find out something to excuse, something
to regret, lamenting that such a
Treasure should fall into unworthy
Hands, insensible of its Value, unskilful
to preserve and improve it: We sigh,
we grieve, that any Person capable of
being an Ornament to a Family, and Blessing
to the Age, should only serve as an
unhappy Shipwreck to point out the
Misfortune of an ill Education and unsuitable
Marriage, and the inexpressible
Danger of seeking Consolation and Relief,
in any thing but Innocence and Vertue.</p>

<p class='c003'>They only who have felt it, know the
Misery of being forc’d to marry where
they do not love; of being yok’d for
Life to a disagreeable Person and imperious
Temper, where Ignorance and Folly
(the Ingredients of a Coxcomb, who
is the most unsufferable Fool) tyrannizes
over Wit and Sense: To be perpetually
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>contradicted for Contradiction-sake,
and bore down by Authority, not by
Argument; to be denied one’s most innocent
Desires, for no other Reason but
the absolute Will and Pleasure of a Lord
and Master, whose Follies a Wife, with
all her Prudence, cannot hide, and whose
Commands she cannot but despise at the
same Time that she obeys them.</p>

<p class='c003'>Or, suppose on the other Hand, she
has married the Man she loves, heap’d
upon him the highest Obligations, by
putting into his Power the Fortune he
coveted, the Beauty he profess’d to adore;
how soon are the Tables turn’d? It is
her Part now to court and fawn; his
real or pretended Passion soon cools into
Indifference, Neglect, or perhaps Aversion.
’Tis well if he preserves a decent
Civility, takes a little care of Appearances,
and is willing to conceal his
Breach of Faith.</p>

<p class='c003'>But shall a Wife retaliate? <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>God</span></em>
forbid! no Provocation, though ever so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>great, can excuse the Sin, or lessen the
Folly: It were indeed a revenging the
Injury upon herself in the most terrible
Manner. The <i>Italian</i> Proverb shews a
much better Way, <i>If you would be revenged
of your Enemies, live well</i>.</p>

<p class='c003'>Devotion is the proper Remedy,
and the only infallible Relief in all Distresses;
when this is neglected or turn’d
into Ridicule, we run, as from one Wickedness,
so from one Misfortune, to another.
Unhappy is that Grandeur which
is too great to be good, and that which
sets us at a Distance from true Wisdom.
Even Bigotry, as contemptible as it is,
is preferable to profane Wit; for <i>that</i>
requires our Pity, but <i>this</i> deserves our
Abhorrence.</p>

<p class='c003'>A Woman who seeks Consolation
under Domestick Troubles from the
Gaieties of a Court, from Gallantry,
Gaming, rambling in Search of odd Adventures,
childish, ridiculous and ill-natur’d
Amusements, such as we find in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>the unhappy Madam <i>M</i>——’s <i>Memoirs</i>,
the common Methods of getting rid of
Time, that is, of our very Being, and
keeping as much as we can at a Distance
from ourselves, will find these are very
insignificant Applications; they hardly
skin the Wound, and can never heal it,
they even hurt, they make it fester,
and render it almost incurable.</p>

<p class='c003'>What an ill Figure does a Woman
make, with all the Charms of her Beauty,
and Sprightliness of her Wit, with
all her good Humour and insinuating
Address, though she be the best Oeconomist
in the World, the most entertaining
Company, if she remit her Guard,
abate in the Severity of her Caution, and
Strictness of her Vertue? If she neglects
those Methods which are necessary to
keep her, not only from a Crime, but
from the very Suspicion of one? She
justifies the Injury her Husband has done
her, by publishing to the World, that
whatever good Qualities she may possess,
Discretion, the Mistress of all the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>rest, is wanting: Though she be really
guiltless, she cannot prove her Innocence,
the Suspicions in her Prejudice are so
strong. When she is censur’d, Charity,
that thinks no Evil, can only be silent;
though it believes and hopes the best,
it cannot engage in her Defence, nor
apologize for irregular Actions.</p>

<p class='c003'>An ill Husband may deprive a Wife
of the Comfort and Quiet of her Life,
give occasion of exercising her Vertue,
try her Patience and Fortitude to the
utmost, which is all he can do; it is
herself only that can accomplish her
Ruin.</p>

<p class='c003'>In vain we seek for Colours to varnish
faulty Manners. An Advocate
shews the best Side of his Wit, but
the worst of his Integrity when he has
an ill Cause to manage: But to what Purpose?
He cannot impose on the Judicious,
his Colouring vanishes before their Eyes,
and a good deal of Malice, with a very
little Sense, will find the Weakness of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>his Arguments; so much the more suspected,
by how much the more labour’d:
For Truth is plain and forcible, depending
on her own Strength; she requires
no more than to be placed in a proper
Light, nor condescends to Art or Insinuations,
unless in Compassion to the
Weakness and Prejudice of Mankind.
Nor are they less mistaken in regard of
Wit, which consists not meerly in saying
what is odd and out of the way; Fools
do this pretty often; but Wit consists in
expressing good Sense in a surprising,
yet natural and agreeable Manner.</p>

<p class='c003'>There are some Reasons, (for the
Laws of <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>God</span></em> and Man allow Divorces
in certain Cases) though not many, that
authorize a Wife’s leaving her Husband,
but if any Thing short of absolute Necessity,
from irreclaimable Vice and Cruelty,
prevails with her to break these
sacred and strongest Bonds, how is she
expos’d to Temptations and Injuries,
Contempt, and the just Censure of the
World. A Woman of Sense, one shou’d
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>think, could take but little Pleasure in
the Courtship and Flatteries of her Adorers,
even when she is single: But for a
married Woman to admit of Love Addresses,
is worse than Folly; it is a Crime
so ridiculous, that I will never believe a
Woman of Sense can be guilty of it.
For what does a Man pretend when he
whines and dangles after a married Woman?
Would he have her think he admires
her, when he is treating her with
the last Contempt? or that he loves her,
when he is trying his Arts to gratify his
brutal Passion, at the Price of all that is
dear to her? His fine Speeches have
either no Meaning, or a reproachful
one; he affronts her Understanding as
well as her Vertue, if he fancies she cannot
discern, or wants Spirit to resent the
Insults. She can look on him no otherwise
than as the worst of Hypocrites,
who flatters to betray, and fawns that
he may ruin; who is laying Snares to
entangle her in a Commerce founded on
Injustice, and Breach of the most sacred
Vows, carried on by Dissimulation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>Treachery, Lyes, and Deceit, attended
with Fear and Anxiety, Shame, Remorse,
the bitter Stings of Guilt, whose
fatal Consequences cannot be foreseen,
the least of which is the blasting of her
Honour. And why all this Mischief?
Why, because he professes to think her
amiable, and with the blackest Treachery
takes Advantage of her Weakness,
and the too good Opinion she has entertained
of him, to render her odious!
to render her contemptible to himself, as
well as to the World.</p>

<p class='c003'>Who would be that unhappy Person
with all her Grandeur, Wit and
Beauty, who gave Occasion to these <i>Reflections</i>?
Who would live so infamously,
and die so miserably? Whatever Apologies
the Interested may invent, what
they call Gallantry will find a harsher
Name with the Modest and Discreet.
Or else Gallantry, under whatever Form,
must pass for a scandalous Amusement,
not to be allow’d among Persons of Vertue
and Honour. It is indeed ridiculous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>to talk of harmless Gallantry; there
is, there can be no such Thing: For
besides the Umbrage and Scandal, a
Christian must be pure in Heart and
Eyes; she who has vow’d her Affections
to one, and is his Property, cannot without
Injustice, and even Perjury, parcel
them out to more.</p>

<p class='c003'>It is in Distempers of the Mind as in
those of the Body, a little Care and
Prudence will prevent what requires a
long and difficult Regimen to cure:
Therefore in both Cases the Aphorism
holds; <i>Resist the Beginnings</i>; be early
on our Guard. There was a Time when
the most abandon’d Sinner would have
shrunk with Horror, at what by Degrees
becomes familiar, and, as they fancy,
natural. The Sap is carry’d on
against Vertue as artfully as against a
fortified Town, and the Approaches are
as methodical: But in this the Case is
different, the Besieged cannot fly; whereas
Vertue is best secured by avoiding
the Enemy. They are sensible of this,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>and therefore nothing more common
than that silly Maxim, <i>That Vertue is
not Vertue till it has been tried</i>. This is
a Mortar-piece that has done more Execution
than all their other Arts; for Self-confidence
is always a Prelude to Destruction.
The Wife who listens to Admirers
runs into Temptation, and sports upon
a Precipice. For, as a noble Lord,
who knew the World perfectly well,
instructs his Daughter, she may as well
play with Fire, as dally with Gallantry.
I can say nothing so well upon this Subject,
as what is writ by this noble Author,
whom therefore I beg leave to
transcribe:</p>

<p class='c003'>“The <i>Extravagancies</i> of the Age
have made <i>Caution</i> more necessary;
and by the same Reason that the too
great Licence of ill Men, hath by
Consequence in many Things restrained
the lawful Liberty of those who
did not abuse it, the unjustifiable
Freedom of some of your Sex, have
involved the rest in the Penalty of being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>reduced. And though this cannot
so alter the Nature of Things, as
to make that <i>Criminal</i>, which in it
self is <i>Indifferent</i>; yet if it maketh it
<i>dangerous</i>, that alone is insufficient to
justify the <i>Restraint</i>. A <i>close Behaviour</i>
is the fittest to receive <i>Vertue</i>
for its constant <i>Guest</i>, because there,
and there only, it can be secure. Proper
<i>Reserves</i> are the Outworks, and
must never be deserted by those who
intend to keep the Place; they keep
off the Possibility not only of being
<i>taken</i>, but of being <i>attempted</i>; and if
a Woman seeth Danger at never so remote
a Distance, she is for that Time
to shorten her <i>Line</i> of <i>Liberty</i>: She
who will allow her self to go to the
<i>utmost Extents</i> of every thing that is
<i>lawful</i>, is so very near going further,
that those who lie at watch, will begin
to count upon her.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Mankind, from the double Temptation
of <i>Vanity</i> and <i>Desire</i>, is apt to
turn every thing a <i>Woman</i> doth to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>the <i>hopeful Side</i>; and there are few
who dare make an impudent Application,
till they discern something
which they are willing to take for an
<i>Encouragement</i>: It is safer therefore to
prevent such <i>Forwardness</i>, than to go
about to <i>cure</i> it: It gathereth Strength
by the first <i>Allowances</i>, and claimeth
Right from having been at any Time
suffered with Impunity: Therefore
nothing is with more Care to be
avoided, than such a kind of <i>Civility</i>
as may be mistaken for <i>Invitation</i>.”</p>

<p class='c003'>In the Time of Yore a <i>Knave</i> was no
more than a Servant, and possibly a <i>Gallant</i>
might originally denote a well-dress’d
Coxcomb, who had nothing else
to do but to make Parade of his Wit and
Cloaths, and perhaps of his Valour in
Tournament, to gain the general Admiration
of the Ladies, and the Honour
of openly professing with Respect and Distance,
his Veneration for some celebrated
Beauty, or Woman of Merit. But
modern Gallantry is quite a different
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>Business: The Gallant, the fine Gentleman
in Town, far superior to him upon
the Road and all his Undergraduates, in
carrying on his Plot, in the artful Contrivance
of his Design, and Dexterity in
executing it, happily combines the Cunning
of the Fox, and the Audacity of the
Tyger. Cruel indeed! for he tears the
Fame, worries the Vertue, and compleats
the Destruction of his unhappy Prey.
’Tis well for him that Christianity as yet
prevails among us, for this obliges its
Votaries to forgive the highest Injuries:
Should the Morality of the honest Heathen,
which some are pleas’d to profess,
but not to practise, become the Fashion,
or the old <i>English</i> Spirit, which has
done and suffered so much for Liberty
and Property, revive among us, alas!
what would become of the <i>pretty Fellows</i>?
Would they not run the Risque of
being taken for Wolves, or Savages,
have a Price set on their Heads, and be
exterminated at any rate, that so among
rational Persons we might be esteem’d a
civiliz’d Nation?</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>These Destroyers avoided, and better
Care taken than usual in Womens
Education, Marriage might recover the
Dignity and Felicity of its original Institution;
and Men be very happy in a
married State, if it be not their own
Fault. The great Author of our Being,
who does nothing in vain, ordained
it as the only honourable Way of
continuing our Race; as a Distinction
between reasonable Creatures and meer
Animals, into which we degrade our
selves, by forsaking the Divine Institution.
<em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>God</span></em> ordained it for a Blessing,
not a Curse: We are foolish as well as
wicked, when that which was appointed
for mutual Comfort and Assistance,
has quite contrary Effect through our
Folly and Perverseness. Marriage therefore,
notwithstanding all the loose Talk
of the Town, the Satires of antient, or
modern Pretenders to Wit, will never
lose its just Esteem from the Wise and
Good.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>Though much may be said against
this, or that Match; though the Ridiculousness
of some, the Wickedness of
others, and the Imprudence of too many,
may provoke our Wonder, or Scorn,
our Indignation or Pity; yet Marriage
in general is too sacred to be treated with
Disrespect, too venerable to be the Subject
of Raillery and Buffoonery. None
but the Impious will pretend to refine
on a Divine Institution, or suppose there
is a better Way for Society and Posterity.
Whoever scoffs at this, and by odious
Representation would possess the
married Pair with a frightful Idea of each
other, as if a Wife is nothing better than
a Domestick Devil, an Evil he must tolerate
for his Conveniency; and an Husband
must of necessity be a Tyrant or a
Dupe; has ill Designs on both, and is
himself a dangerous Enemy to the Publick,
as well as to private Families.</p>

<p class='c003'>But upon what are the Satires against
Marriage grounded? Not upon the State
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>it self, if they are just, but upon the ill
Choice, or foolish Conduct of those who
are in it? and what has Marriage consider’d
in it self to do with these? When
the Blame is laid where it ought to be,
not Marriage, but inordinate Passion,
Rashness, Humour, Pride, Covetousness,
Inconstancy, unjust Suspicions, unnecessary
Severity, and, in a Word, a
silly, vicious, imprudent Choice, or Conduct,
ought to be arraign’d. For why
should Marriage be exclaim’d against
when Men reap the Fruit of their own
Folly? If they will put an unequal
Yoke upon their own Necks, they have
their Choice, who can they blame for it?
If instead of a Help and Comfort, their
Courtship has procured them a Plague
and Disgrace, who may they thank but
themselves: A Man can never be under
any sort of Obligation to marry against
his Liking, but through some reigning
Vice, or want of Fortitude.</p>

<p class='c003'>Could there be no happy Marriages,
Arguments against Matrimony might
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>have their Weight with the Reasonable
as well as the Licentious. But since the
Laws of <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>God</span></em> and Man, founded upon
Reason and Experience, forbid a Temporary
Contract, and engage the married
Pair for Life, it is not only possible,
but highly probable, and not without
many eminent Instances, that there are
and may be, happy Marriages; provided
we act reasonably in our Choice and
Conduct, acquit our selves like wise
Men and Christians. So that all we have
to say against Matrimony, seems only
to shew the Levity, or Impiety of our
own Minds: It is no more than a Flourish
of Wit, and how prettily soever we
may talk, it is but little to the Purpose.</p>

<p class='c003'>Is it the being tied to <i>One</i> that offends
us? Why this ought rather to recommend
it to us, and would really do
so, were we guided by Reason, and
not by Humour or brutish Passion. He
who does not make Friendship the chief
Inducement to his Choice, and prefer it
before any other Consideration, does not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>deserve a good Wife, and therefore
should not complain if he goes without
one. Now we can never grow weary
of our Friends; the longer we have had
them the more they are endear’d to us;
and if we have One well assur’d, we
need seek no farther, but are sufficiently
happy in her. The Love of Variety in
this and in other Cases, shews only the
ill Temper of our own Mind in that;
for instead of being content with a competent
Share of Good, thankfully and
chearfully enjoying what is afforded us,
and patiently bearing with the Inconveniencies
that attend it, we would set
up our Rest here, and expect Felicity
where it is not to be found.</p>

<p class='c003'>The Christian Institution of Marriage
provides the best that may be for
Domestick Quiet and Content, and for
the Education of Children; so that if
we were not under the Tie of Religion,
even the Good of Society and civil Duty,
would oblige us to what Christianity requires:
And since the very best of us
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>are but poor frail Creatures, full of Ignorance
and Infirmity, so that in Justice
we ought to tolerate each other, and exercise
that Patience towards our Companions
to Day, which we shall give them
occasion to shew towards us To-morrow;
the more we are accustom’d to any one’s
Conversation, the better shall we understand
their Humour, be more able to
comply with their Weakness, and less
offended at it. For he who would have
every one submit to his Humours, and
will not in his Turn comply with them,
(though we should suppose him always
in the right, whereas a Man of this Temper
very seldom is so) is not fit for a
Husband, scarce fit for Society, but
ought to be turn’d out of the Herd as
an unreasonable Creature.</p>

<p class='c003'>There may indeed be Inconveniencies
in a married Life; but is there any
Condition without them? And he who
lives single, that he may indulge Licentiousness
and give up himself to the Conduct
of wild and ungovern’d Desires, (or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>indeed out of any other Inducement, than
the Glory of <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>God</span></em> and the Good of his
Soul, through the Prospect he has of
doing more Good, or because his Frame
and Disposition of Mind are more fit for
a single than a married Life) may rail as
he pleases against Matrimony, but can
never justify his own Conduct, nor clear
it from the Imputation of Wickedness
and Folly.</p>

<p class='c003'>But if Marriage be such a blessed
State, how comes it, may you say, that
there are so few happy Marriages? Now
in answer to this, it is not to be wonder’d
that so few succeed; we should rather
be surpriz’d to find so many do, considering
how imprudently Men engage,
the Motives they act by, and the very
strange Conduct they observe throughout.</p>

<p class='c003'>For pray, what do Men propose to
themselves in Marriage? What Qualifications
do they look after in a Spouse?
What will she bring? is the first Enquiry:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>How many Acres? Or how much ready
Coin? Not that this is altogether an unnecessary
Question, for Marriage without
a Competency, that is, not only a
bare Subsistence, but even a handsome
and plentiful provision, according to the
Quality and Circumstances of the Parties,
is no very comfortable Condition. They
who marry for Love, as they call it,
find Time enough to repent their rash
Folly, and are not long in being convinc’d,
that whatever fine Speeches
might be made in the Heat of Passion,
there could be no <i>real Kindness</i> between
those who can agree to make each other
miserable. But tho’ an Estate is to be
consider’d, it should not be the <i>Main</i>,
much less the only Consideration; for
Happiness does not depend on Wealth;
That may be wanting, and too often is,
where This abounds. He who marries
himself to a Fortune only, must expect no
other Satisfaction than that can bring him;
but let him not say that Marriage, but
that his own covetous or prodigal Temper,
has made him unhappy. What Joy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>has that Man in all his Plenty, who must
either run from home to possess it, contrary
to all the Rules of Justice, to the
Laws of <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>God</span></em> and Man, nay, even in
Opposition to good Nature and good
Breeding too, which some Men make
more Account of than of all the rest; or
else be forc’d to share it with a Woman
whose Person or Temper is disagreeable,
whose Presence is sufficient to sour all his
Enjoyments, so that if he has any Remains
of Religion or good Manners, he
must suffer the Uneasiness of a continual
Watch, to force himself to a constrain’d
Civility?</p>

<p class='c003'>Few Men have so much Goodness as
to bring themselves to a Liking of what
they loath’d, meerly because it is their
Duty to like; on the contrary, when
they marry with an Indifferency, to
please their Friends or increase their Fortune,
the Indifferency proceeds to an
Aversion, and perhaps even the Kindness
and Complaisance of the poor abus’d
Wife, shall only serve to increase it.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>What follows then? There is no Content
at home, so it is sought elsewhere,
and the Fortune so unjustly got, is as
carelesly squander’d; the Man takes a
Loose, what should hinder him? He has
all in his Hands, and Custom has almost
taken off that small Restraint Reputation
us’d to lay. The Wife finds too late
what was the Idol the Man adored,
which her Vanity, perhaps, or it may
be the Commands and Importunities of
Relations, would not let her see before;
and now he has got That into his Possession,
she must make Court to him for a
little sorry Alimony out of her own
Estate. If Discretion and Piety prevail
upon her Passions, she sits down
quietly contented with her Lot, seeks no
Consolation in the Multitude of Adorers,
since he whom only she desir’d to please,
because it was her Duty to do so, will
take no Delight in her Wit or Beauty:
She follows no Diversion to allay her
Grief, uses no Cordials to support her
Spirit, that may sully her Vertue or bring
a Cloud upon her Reputation; she makes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>no Appeals to the mis-judging Croud,
hardly mentions her Misfortunes to her
most intimate Acquaintance, nor lays a
Load on her Husband to ease her self;
but would, if it were possible, conceal
his Crimes, though her Prudence and
Vertue give him a thousand Reproaches
without her Intention or Knowledge;
and retiring from the World, she seeks a
more solid Comfort than it can give her,
taking Care to do nothing that Censoriousness,
or even Malice it self can misconstrue
to her Prejudice. Now she
puts on all her Reserves, and thinks even
innocent Liberties scarce allowable in
her disconsolate State; she has other Business
to mind: Nor does she in her Retirements
reflect so much upon the Hand
that administers this bitter Cup, as consider
what is the best Use she can make
of it. And thus indeed, Marriage,
however unfortunate in other respects,
becomes a very great Blessing to her.
She might have been exposed to all the
Temptations of a plentiful Fortune,
have given up her self to Sloth and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>Luxury, and gone on at the common
rate, even of the better Sort, in doing
no Hurt, and as little Good: But now
her kind Husband obliges her to <i>Consider</i>,
and gives Opportunity to exercise
her Vertue; he makes it necessary to
withdraw from those Gaieties and Pleasures
of Life, which do more Mischief
under the Shew of Innocency, than they
could if they appear’d attended with a
Crime, discomposing and dissolving the
Mind, and making it uncapable of any
manner of Good, to be sure of any thing
Great and Excellent. Silence and Solitude,
the being forc’d from the ordinary
Entertainments of her Station, may perhaps
seem a desolate Condition at first,
and we may allow her, poor weak Woman!
to be somewhat shock’d at it, since
even a wise and courageous Man perhaps
would not keep his Ground. We would
conceal (if we could) for the Honour of
the Sex, Mens being baffled and dispirited
by a smaller matter, were not the
Instances too frequent and too notorious.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>But a little Time wears off all the
Uneasiness, and puts her in possession of
Pleasures, which till now she has unkindly
been kept a Stranger to. Affliction,
the sincerest Friend, the frankest Monitor,
the best Instructor, and indeed, the
only useful School that Women are ever
put to, rouzes her Understanding, opens
her Eyes, fixes her Attention, and diffuses
such a Light, such a Joy into her
Mind, as not only Informs her better,
but Entertains her more than ever her
<i>Ruel</i> did, though crouded by the Men
of Wit. She now distinguishes between
Truth and Appearances, between solid
and apparent Good; has found out the
Instability of all earthly Things, and
won’t any more be deceived by relying
on them; can discern who are the Flatterers
of her Fortune, and who the Admirers
and Encouragers of her Vertue;
accounting it no little Blessing to be rid
of those Leeches, who hung upon her
only for their own Advantage. Now
sober Thoughts succeed to Hurry and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>Impertinence, to Forms and Ceremony;
she can secure her Time, and knows how
to improve it; never truly a happy Woman
till she came, in the Eye of the
World, to be reckon’d Miserable.</p>

<p class='c003'>Thus the Husband’s Vices may become
an Occasion of the Wife’s Vertues,
and his Neglect do her a more real Good
than his Kindness could. But all injur’d
Wives don’t behave themselves after this
Fashion, nor can their Husbands justly
expect it. With what Face can he
blame her for following his Example,
and being as extravagant on the one
Hand, as he is on the other? Though
she cannot justify her Excesses to <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>God</span></em>,
to the World, nor to her Self, yet surely
in respect of him they may admit of
an Excuse. For to all the rest of his
Absurdities, (for Vice is always unreasonable)
he adds one more, who expects
that Vertue from another which he won’t
practise himself.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>But suppose a Man does not marry
for Money, though for one that does
not, perhaps there are thousands that
do; suppose he marries for Love, an
Heroick Action, which makes a mighty
Noise in the World, partly because of
its Rarity, and partly in regard of its Extravagancy,
what does his marrying for
Love amount to? There’s no great Odds
between his marrying for the Love of
Money, or for the Love of Beauty; the
Man does not act according to Reason
in either Case, but is govern’d by irregular
Appetites. But he loves her Wit
perhaps, and this, you’ll say, is more Spiritual,
more Refin’d: Not at all, if you
examine it to the Bottom. For what is
that which now a-days passes under the
Name of Wit? A bitter and ill-natur’d
Raillery, a pert Repartee, or a confident
talking at all; and in such a multitude
of Words, it’s Odds if something or
other does not pass that is surprizing,
though every Thing that surprizes does
not please; some Things being wonder’d
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>at for their Ugliness, as well as others
for their Beauty. True Wit, durst one
venture to describe it, is quite another
Thing; it consists in such a Sprightliness
of Imagination, such a Reach and Turn
of Thought, so properly express’d, as
strikes and pleases a judicious Taste.
For though, as one says of Beauty, <i>’tis
in no Face, but in the Lover’s Mind</i>, so
it may be said of some sorts of Wit, it is
not in him that speaks, but in the Imagination
of his Hearer; yet doubtless
there is a true Standard-Wit, which
must be allow’d for such by every one
who understands the Terms. I don’t
say that they shall all <i>equally</i> like it; and
it is this Standard-wit that always pleases,
the Spurious does so only for a Season.</p>

<p class='c003'>Now what is it that strikes a judicious
Taste? Not that, to be sure, which
injures the Absent, or provokes the
Company, which poisons the Mind under
Pretence of entertaining it, proceeding
from, or giving Countenance to false
Notions, to dangerous and immoral Principles.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>Wit indeed is distinct from
Judgment, but it is not contrary to it;
’tis rather its Handmaid, serving to awaken
and fix the Attention, that so we
may judge rightly. Whatever charms,
does so because of its Regularity and
Proportion; otherwise, though it is Extraordinary
and out of the Way, it will
only be star’d on like a Monster, but
can never be lik’d. And tho’ a Thought
is ever so fine and new, ever so well
express’d, if it suits not with Decorum
and good Manners, it is not just and fit,
and therefore offends our Reason, and
consequently has no real Charms, nor
would afford us any Entertainment, if
our Taste were not deprav’d.</p>

<p class='c003'>But it must not be suppos’d that Womens
Wit approaches those Heights
which Men arrive at, or that they indulge
those Liberties the other take.
Decency lays greater Restraints on them,
their Timorousness does them this one,
and perhaps this only Piece of Service,
it keeps them from breaking through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>these Restraints, and following their
Masters and Guides in many of their
daring and masculine Crimes. As the
World goes, your Witty Men are usually
distinguish’d by the Liberty they take
with Religion, good Manners, or their
Neighbours Reputation: But, <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>God</span></em> be
thank’d, it is not yet so bad, as that
Women should form Cabals to propagate
Atheism and Irreligion<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c011'><sup>[1]</sup></a>. A Man
then cannot hope to find a Woman
whose Wit is of a Size with his, but
when he doats on Wit, it is to be imagin’d
he makes Choice of that which
comes the nearest to his own.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c003'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. <i>This was wrote in the Beginning of the present Century.</i></p>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Thus, whether it be Wit or Beauty
that a Man’s in Love with, there are no
great Hopes of a lasting Happiness;
Beauty, with all the Helps of Art, is of
no long Date; the more it is help’d, the
sooner it decays; and he, who only or
chiefly chose for Beauty, will in a little
Time find the same Reason for another
Choice. Nor is that sort of Wit which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>he prefers, of a more sure Tenure; or
allowing it to last, it will not always
please. For that which has not a real
Excellency and Value in it self, entertains
no longer than that giddy Humour
which recommended it to us holds; and
when we can like on no just, or on very
little Ground, ’tis certain a Dislike will
arise, as lightly and as unaccountably.
And it is not improbable that such a
Husband may in a little Time, by ill
Usage, provoke such a Wife to exercise
her Wit, that is, her Spleen on him,
and then it is not hard to guess how
very agreeable it will be to him.</p>

<p class='c003'>In a word, when we have reckon’d
up how many look no further than the
making of their Fortune, as they call it;
who don’t so much as propose to themselves
any Satisfaction in the Woman to
whom they plight their Faith, seeking
only to be Masters of her Estate, that
so they may have Money enough to indulge
all their irregular Appetites; who
think they are as good as can be expected,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>if they are but, according to the
fashionable Term, <i>Civil Husbands</i>; when
we have taken the Number of your giddy
Lovers, who are not more violent in
their Passion than they are certain to
repent of it; when to these you have
added such as marry without any
Thought at all, further than that it is
the Custom of the World, what others
have done before them, that the Family
must be kept up, the antient Race preserv’d,
and therefore their kind Parents
and Guardians choose as they think convenient,
without ever consulting the
Young one’s Inclinations, who must be
satisfied, or pretend so at least, upon
Pain of their Displeasure, and that heavy
Consequence of it, Forfeiture of their
Estate: These set aside, I fear there will
be but a small Remainder to marry out
of better Considerations; and even
amongst the Few that do, not one in a
Hundred takes Care to deserve his Choice.</p>

<p class='c003'>But do the Women never choose
amiss? Are the Men only in Fault?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>That is not pretended; for he who will
be just, must be forced to acknowledge,
that neither Sex are always in the right.
A Woman, indeed, can’t properly be
said to Choose; all that is allow’d her,
is to Refuse or Accept what is offer’d.
And when we have made such reasonable
Allowances as are due to the Sex,
perhaps they may not appear so much
in Fault as one would at first imagine,
and a generous Spirit will find more Occasion
to Pity, than to Reprove. But
sure I transgress——it must not be suppos’d
that the Ladies can do amiss! He
is but an ill-bred Fellow who pretends
that they need Amendment! They are,
no doubt on’t, always in the right, and
most of all when they take Pity on distressed
Lovers! Whatever they <i>say</i> carries
an Authority that no Reason can
resist, and all that they <i>do</i> must needs be
Exemplary! This is the Modish Language,
nor is there a Man of Honour
amongst the whole Tribe, that would
not venture his Life, nay, and his Salvation
too, in their Defence, if any but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>himself attempts to injure them. But I
must ask Pardon if I can’t come up to
these Heights, nor flatter them with the
having no Faults, which is only a malicious
Way of continuing and increasing
their Mistakes.</p>

<p class='c003'>Women, it’s true, ought to be treated
with Civility; for since a little Ceremony
and out-side Respect is all their
Guard, all the Privilege that’s allow’d
them, it were barbarous to deprive them
of it; and because I would treat them
civilly, I would not express my Civility
at the usual rate. I would not, under
Pretence of Honouring and paying a
mighty Deference to the Ladies, call
them Fools, or what’s worse, to their
Faces; For what are all the fine Speeches
and Submissions that are made, but an
abusing them in a well-bred Way? She
must be a Fool with a Witness, who can
believe a Man, Proud and Vain as he is,
will lay his boasted Authority, the Dignity
and Prerogative of his Sex, one
Moment at her Feet, but in Prospect of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>taking it up again to more Advantage;
he may call himself her Slave a few
Days, but it is only in order to make
her his all the rest of his Life.</p>

<p class='c003'>Indeed that mistaken Self-Love that
reigns in the most of us, both Men and
Women, that over-good Opinion we have
of ourselves, and Desire that others should
have of us, makes us swallow every
Thing that looks like Respect, without
examining how wide it is from what it
appears to be. For nothing is in Truth
a greater Outrage than Flattery and
feign’d Submissions; the plain <i>English</i> of
which is this, “I have a very mean
Opinion both of your Understanding
and Vertue; you are Weak enough to
be impos’d on, and Vain enough to
snatch at the Bait I throw; there’s no
Danger of your finding out my Meaning,
or disappointing me of my Ends.
I offer you <i>Incense</i>, ’tis true, but you
are like to pay for’t, and to make me
a Recompence for your Folly, in imagining
I would give my self this Trouble,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>did I not hope, nay, were I not
sure, to find my own Account in it.
If for nothing else, you’ll serve at
least as an Exercise of my Wit; and
how much soever you swell with
my Breath, ’tis I deserve the Praise for
talking so well on so poor a Subject.
We, who make the Idols, are the
greater Deities; and as we set you up,
so it is in our Power to reduce you to
your first Obscurity, or to somewhat
worse, to Contempt; you are therefore
only on your good Behaviour,
and are like to be no more than what
we please to make you.” This is
the Flatterer’s Language aside, this is
the true Sense of his Heart, whatever his
Grimace may be before the Company.</p>

<p class='c003'>And if this be the true Meaning of
honourable Courtship, what is meant by
that Jargon, that Profusion of Love and
Admiration which passes for Gallantry,
when either of the Parties are married?
Is it not the utmost Scurrility, in that
it supposes she is, or that he hopes to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>make her, what good Manners forbids to
name? And since he makes so free with
the Lady’s Honour, can she afford him
a civiller Answer, than what her Footman
may deliver with a Crab-tree? But
I correct my self,——this might be the
Air of a haughty <i>Roman</i> Prude; our
<i>British</i> Beauties are far more Gentle and
Well-bred. And he who has the same
Designs upon other Mens Relations, is
sometimes so civil as to bear with the
Outrages offer’d to his own.</p>

<p class='c003'>Not but that ’tis possible, and sometimes
Matter of Fact, to express our
selves beyond the Truth in Praise of a
Person, and yet not be guilty of Flattery;
but then we must Think what
we Say, and Mean what we Profess.
We may be so blinded by some Passion
or other, especially Love, which in Civil
and Good-natur’d Persons is apt to
exceed, as to believe some Persons more
deserving than really they are, and to
pay them greater Respect and Kindness
than is in Strictness due to them. But
this is not the present Case; for our fine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>Speech-makers doat too much on themselves
to have any great Passion for
another. Their Eyes are commonly too
much fix’d on their own Excellencies, to
view another’s good Qualities through a
Magnifying-Glass; at least if ever they
turn that End of the Perspective towards
their Neighbours, ’tis only in Respect
and Reference to themselves. They are
their own Centres, they find a Disproportion
in every Line that does not tend
thither, and in the next Visit they make,
you shall hear all the fine Things they
had said, repeated to the new Object,
and nothing remembred of the former
but her Vanity, or something else as ridiculous,
which serves for a Foil, or a
Whet to Discourse. For let there be
ever so many Wits in the Company,
Conversation would languish, and they
would be at a Loss, did not a little Censoriousness
come in at a Need to help
them.</p>

<p class='c003'>Let us then treat the Ladies as civilly
as may be, but let us not do it by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>Flattering them, but by endeavouring
to make them such as may truly deserve
our hearty Esteem and Kindness. Men
ought really for their own Sakes, to do
what in them lies to make Women Wise
and Good, and then it might be hoped
they themselves would effectually Study
and Practice that Wisdom and Vertue
they recommend to others. But so long
as Men, even the best of them, who do
not outrage the Women they pretend to
adore, have base and unworthy Ends to
serve, it is not to be expected that they
should consent to such Methods as would
certainly disappoint them. They would
have their own Relations do well; it is
their Interest: but it sometimes happens
to be for their Turn that another Man’s
should not, and then their Generosity
fails them, and no Man is apter to find
Fault with another’s dishonourable Actions,
than he who is ready to do, or perhaps
has done the same himself.</p>

<p class='c003'>And as Men have little Reason to expect
Happiness when they marry only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>for the Love of Money, Wit, or Beauty,
as has been already shewn, so much less
can a Woman expect a tolerable Life,
when she goes upon these Considerations.
Let the Business be carried as
prudently as it can be on the Woman’s
Side, a reasonable Man can’t deny that
she has by much the harder Bargain:
because she puts her self intirely into her
Husband’s Power, and if the Matrimonial
Yoke be grievous, neither Law nor
Custom afford her that Redress which a
Man obtains. He who has Sovereign
Power does not value the Provocations of
a Rebellious Subject; he knows how to
subdue him with Ease, and will make
himself obey’d: But Patience and Submission
are the only Comforts that are
left to a poor People, who groan under
Tyranny, unless they are Strong enough
to break the Yoke, to Depose and Abdicate,
which, I doubt, would not be
allow’d of here. For whatever may be
said against Passive-Obedience in another
Case, I suppose there’s no Man but likes
it very well in this; how much soever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>Arbitrary Power may be dislik’d on a
Throne, not <i>Milton</i>, nor <i>B. H—</i>, nor
any of the Advocates of Resistance,
would cry up Liberty to poor <i>Female
Slaves</i>, or plead for the Lawfulness of
Resisting a private Tyranny.</p>

<p class='c003'>If there be a Disagreeableness of Humours,
this, in my Mind, is harder to
be born than greater Faults, as being a
continual Plague, and for the most Part
incurable. Other Vices a Man may grow
weary of, or may be convinced of the
Evil of them, he may forsake them, or
they him, but his Humour and Temper
are seldom, if ever, put off. Ill-nature
sticks to him from his Youth to his grey
Hairs, and a Boy that’s Humorous and
Proud, makes a Peevish, Positive, and
Insolent Old Man. Now if this be the
Case, and the Husband be full of Himself,
obstinately bent on his own Way,
with or without Reason, if he be one
who must be always Admir’d, always
Humour’d, and yet scarce knows what
will please him; if he has Prosperity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>enough to keep him from considering,
and to furnish him with a Train of Flatterers
and obsequious Admirers; and
Learning and Sense enough to make him
a Fop in Perfection; for a Man can
never be a compleat Coxcomb, unless
he has a considerable Share of these to
value himself upon; What can the poor
Woman do? The Husband is too Wise
to be Advis’d, too Good to be Reform’d,
she must follow all his Paces, and tread
in all his unreasonable Steps, or there is
no Peace, no Quiet for her; she must
Obey with the greatest Exactness, ’tis in
vain to expect any manner of Compliance
on his Side, and the more she complies
the more she may; his fantastical
Humours grow with her Desire to gratify
them, for Age increases Opinionatry in
some, as well as it does Experience in
others. Of such sort of Folks as these
it was that <i>Soloman</i> spake, when he said,
<i>Seest thou a Man wise in his own Conceit,
there is more hope of a Fool than of him</i>;
That is, the profligate Sinner, such a
one being always a Fool in <i>Solomon’s</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>Language, is in a fairer Way of being
convinc’d of his Folly, and brought to
Reason, than the Proud, Conceited Man.
That Man, indeed, can never be good
at Heart, who is full of Himself and his
own Endowments: Not that it is necessary,
because it is not possible (humanly
speaking) for one to be totally ignorant
of his own good Qualities, I had
almost said, he <i>ought</i> to have a modest
Sense of ’em, otherwise he can’t be duly
thankful, nor make the Use of them that
is required, to the Glory of <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>God</span></em>, and
the Good of Mankind; but he views
them in a wrong Light, if he discerns
any Thing that may exalt him above his
Neighbours, make him over-look their
Merit, or treat them with Neglect or
Contempt. He ought to behold them
with Fear and Trembling, as Talents
which he has freely receiv’d, and for
which he is highly Accountable, and
therefore they should not excite his Pride,
but his Care and Industry.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>And if Pride and Self-conceit keep a
Man who has some good Qualities, and
is not so bad as the most of his Neighbours,
from growing better, it for certain
confirms and hardens the Wicked
in his Crimes, it sets him up for a Wit,
that is, according to modern Acceptation,
one who rallies all that is serious, a
Contemner of the Priests first, and then
of the Deity Himself. For Penitence
and Self-condemnation are what his
Haughtiness cannot bear, and since his
Crimes have brought upon him the Reproaches
of his own Mind, since he will
not take the regular Way to be rid of
them, which is, by Humbling himself,
and making his Peace with Heaven, he
bids Defiance to it, and wou’d, if he
could, believe there is no future State, no
After-retribution, because he has too
just Reason to fear it.</p>

<p class='c003'>If therefore it be a Woman’s hard
Fate to meet with a disagreeable Temper,
and of all others, the Haughty,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>Imperious, and Self-conceited are the
most so, she is as unhappy as any Thing
in this World can make her. For when
a Wife’s Temper does not please, if she
makes her Husband uneasy, he can find
Entertainments Abroad; he has a hundred
Ways of relieving himself; but
neither Prudence nor Duty will allow a
Woman to fly out: her Business and Entertainment
are at home; and tho’ he
makes it ever so uneasy to her, she must
be content, and make her best on’t. She
who elects a Monarch for Life, who
gives him an Authority, she cannot recall,
however he misapply it, who puts
her Fortune and Person entirely in his
Power, nay, even the very Desires of her
Heart, according to some learned Casuists,
so as that it is not lawful to Will
or Desire any Thing but what he approves
and allows, had need be very sure
that she does not make a Fool her Head,
nor a Vicious Man her Guide and Pattern;
she had best stay till she can meet
with one who has the Government of his
own Passions, and has duly regulated his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>own Desires, since he is to have such
an absolute Power over hers. But
he who doats on a Face, he who makes
Money his Idol, he who is charm’d with
vain and empty Wit, gives no such Evidence,
either of Wisdom or Goodness,
that a Woman of any tolerable Sense
shou’d care to venture her self to his
Conduct.</p>

<p class='c003'>Indeed, your fine Gentleman’s Actions
are now a-days such, that did not
Custom and the Dignity of his Sex give
Weight and Authority to them, a Woman
that thinks twice might bless her
self, and say, Is this the Lord and Master
to whom I am to promise Love,
Honour and Obedience? What can be
the Object of Love but amiable Qualities,
the Image of the Deity impress’d
upon a generous and godlike Mind, a
Mind that is above this World, to be
sure above all the Vices, the Tricks and
Baseness of it; a Mind that is not full
of it self, nor contracted to little private
Interests, but which, in Imitation of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>that glorious Pattern it endeavours to
copy after, expands and diffuses it self
to its utmost Capacity in doing Good.
But this fine Gentleman is quite of another
Strain, he is the Reverse of this in
every Instance. He is, I confess, very
fond of his own Dear Person, he sees
very much in it to admire; his Air and
Mien, his Words and Actions, every
Motion he makes, declare it; but they
must have a Judgment of his Size, every
whit as shallow, and a Partiality as great
as his own, who can be of his Mind.
How then can I Love? And if not Love,
much less Honour. Love may arise
from Pity, or a generous Desire to make
that Lovely which as yet is not so, when
we see any hopes of Success in our Endeavours
of improving it; but Honour
supposes some excellent Qualities already,
something worth our Esteem; but,
alas! there is nothing more contemptible
than this Trifle of a Man, this meer
Out-side, whose Mind is as base and
mean as his external Pomp is glittering.
His Office or Title apart, to which some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>ceremonious Observance must be paid
for Order’s sake, there’s nothing in him
that can command our Respect. Strip
him of Equipage and Fortune, and such
Things as only dazle our Eyes and Imaginations,
but don’t in any measure affect
our Reason, or cause a Reverence
in our Hearts, and the poor Creature
sinks beneath our Notice, because not
supported by real Worth. And if a
Woman can neither Love nor Honour,
she does ill in promising to Obey, since
she is like to have a crooked Rule to regulate
her Actions.</p>

<p class='c003'>A Meer Obedience, such as is paid
only to Authority, and not out of Love
and a Sense of the Justice and Reasonableness
of the Command, will be of an
uncertain Tenure. As it can’t but be
uneasy to the Person who pays it, so he
who receives it will be sometimes disappointed
when he expects to find it: For
that Woman must be endow’d with a
Wisdom and Goodness much above what
we suppose the Sex capable of, I fear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>much greater than any Man can pretend
to, who can so constantly conquer her
Passions, and divert her self even of Innocent
Self-love, as to give up the
Cause when she is in the Right, and to
submit her inlightned Reason, to the
imperious Dictates of a blind Will, and
wild Imagination, even when she clearly
perceives the ill Consequences of it, the
Imprudence, nay, Folly and Madness of
such a Conduct.</p>

<p class='c003'>And if a Woman runs such a Risque
when she marries prudently, according
to the Opinion of the World, that is,
when she permits her self to be dispos’d
of to a Man equal to her in Birth, Education
and Fortune, and as good as the
most of his Neighbours, (for if none
were to marry, but Men of strict Vertue
and Honour, I doubt the World would
be but thinly Peopled) if at the very best
her Lot is hard, what can she expect
who is Sold, or any otherwise betray’d
into mercenary Hands, to one who is in
all, or most respects, unequal to her?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>A Lover who comes upon what is call’d
equal Terms, makes no very advantageous
Proposal to the Lady he courts,
and to whom he seems to be an humble
Servant. For under many sounding
Compliments, Words that have nothing
in them, this is his true Meaning; He
wants one to manage his Family, an
House-keeper, one whose Interest it will
be not to wrong him, and in whom
therefore he can put greater Confidence
than in any he can hire for Money. One
who may breed his Children, taking all
the Care and Trouble of their Education,
to preserve his Name and Family.
One whose Beauty, Wit, or good Humour
and agreeable Conversation, will
entertain him at Home when he has been
contradicted and disappointed Abroad;
who will do him that Justice the ill-natur’d
World denies him; that is, in any
one’s Language but his own, sooth his
Pride and flatter his Vanity, by having
always so much good Sense as to be on
his Side, to conclude him in the Right,
when others are so ignorant, or so rude,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>as to deny it. Who will not be blind
to his Merit nor contradict his Will and
Pleasure, but make it her Business, her
very Ambition to content him; whose
Softness and gentle Compliance will calm
his Passions, to whom he may safely disclose
his troublesome Thoughts, and in
her Breast discharge his Cares; whose
Duty, Submission and Observance, will
heal those Wounds other Peoples Opposition
or Neglect have given him. In a
word, one whom he can intirely Govern,
and consequently may form her to his
Will and Liking, who must be his for
Life, and therefore cannot quit his Service,
let him treat her how he will.</p>

<p class='c003'>And if this be what every Man expects,
the Sum of his violent Love and
Courtship, when it is put into Sense, and
rendred Intelligible, to what a fine pass
does she bring her self who purchases a
Lord and Master, not only with her
Money, but with what is of greater
Value, at the Price of her Discretion!
Who has not so much as that poor Excuse,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>Precedent and Example; or if she
has, they are only such as all the World
condemns? She will not find him less a
Governor because she was once his Superior,
on the contrary, the Scum of the
People are most Tyrannical when they
get the Power, and treat their Betters
with the greatest Insolence. For, as the
wise Man long since observ’d, A Servant
when he Reigns, is one of those Things
for which the Earth is disquieted, and
which no body is able to bear.</p>

<p class='c003'>It is the hardest Thing in the World
for a Woman to know that a Man is not
Mercenary, that he does not act on base
and ungenerous Principles, even when he
is her Equal, because being absolute Master,
she and all the Grants he makes her
are in his Power, and there have been
but too many Instances of Husbands,
that by wheedling, or threatning their
Wives, by seeming Kindness, or cruel
Usage, have persuaded, or forc’d them
out of what has been settled on them.
So that the Woman has in Truth no Security
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>but the Man’s Honour and Good-nature,
a Security that in this present
Age no wise Person would venture much
upon. A Man enters into Articles very
readily before Marriage, and so he may,
for he performs no more of them afterwards
than he thinks fit. A Wife must
never dispute with her Husband; his
Reasons are now, no doubt on’t, better
than hers, whatever they were before;
he is sure to persuade her out of her
Agreement, and bring her, it must be
suppos’d, <i>Willingly</i>, to give up what
she did vainly hope to obtain, and what
she thought had been made sure to her.
And if she shews any Refractoriness,
there are Ways enough to humble her;
so that by Right or Wrong the Husband
gains his Will. For Covenants between
Husband and Wife, like Laws in an Arbitrary
Government, are of little Force,
the Will of the Sovereign is All in All.
Thus it is in Matter of Fact, I will not
answer for the Right of it; for if the
Woman’s Reasons, upon which those
Agreements are grounded, are not just
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>and good, why did he consent to them?
Was it because there was no other Way
to obtain his Suit, and with an Intention
to annul them when it shall be in his
Power? Where then is his Sincerity?
But if her Reasons are good, where is
his Justice in obliging her to quit them?
He neither way acts like an equitable or
honest Man.</p>

<p class='c003'>But when a Woman marries unequally
and beneath her self, there is almost
Demonstration that the Man is sordid
and unfair; that instead of loving her
he only loves himself, trapans and ruins
her to serve his own Ends. For if he
had not a mighty Opinion of himself,
(which Temper is like to make an admirable
Husband) he would never imagine
that his Person and good Qualities
could make Compensation for all the Advantages
she quits on his Account. If
he had a real Esteem for her, or valued
her Reputation, he would not expose it,
nor have her Discretion call’d in Question
for his sake; and if he truly lov’d
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>her, he would not reduce her to Straits
and a narrow Fortune, nor so much as lessen
her way of Living to better his own.
For since God has placed different Ranks
in the World, put some in a higher,
and some in a lower Station, for Order
and Beauty’s sake, and for many good
Reasons; though it is both our Wisdom
and Duty not only to submit with Patience,
but to be thankful and well-satisfied,
when by his Providence we are
brought low, yet there is no manner of
Reason for us to degrade our selves; on
the contrary, much why we ought not.
The better our Lot is in this World,
and the more we have of it, the greater
is our Leisure to prepare for the next;
we have the more Opportunity to exercise
that God-like Quality, to taste that
Divine Pleasure, doing Good to the Bodies
and Souls of those beneath us. Is it
not then ill Manners to Heaven, and an
irreligious Contempt of its Favours, for
a Woman to slight that nobler Employment,
to which it has assign’d her, and
thrust her self down to a meaner Drudgery,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>to what is in the very literal Sense
a caring for the Things of the World, a
caring not only to Please, but to Maintain
a Husband?</p>

<p class='c003'>And a Husband so chosen will not at
all abate of his Authority and Right to
Govern, whatever fair Promises he might
make before. She has made him her
Head, and he thinks himself as well
qualified as the Best to act accordingly,
nor has she given him any such Evidence
of her Prudence as may dispose him to
make an Act of Grace in her Favour.
Besides, great Obligations are what Superiors
cannot bear, they are more than
can be return’d; to acknowledge were
only to reproach themselves with Ingratitude,
and therefore the readiest Way
is, not to own, but over-look them, or
rather, as too many do, to repay them
with Affronts and Injuries.</p>

<p class='c003'>What then is to be done? How must
a Man choose, and what Qualities must
incline a Woman to accept, that so our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>married Couple may be as happy as that
State can make them? This is no hard
Question; let the Soul be principally
consider’d, and Regard had in the first
place to a good Understanding, a vertuous
Mind; and in all other respects
let there be as much Equality as may
be. If they are good Christians and of
suitable Tempers all will be well; but I
should be shrewdly tempted to suspect
their Christianity who marry after any
of those Ways we have been speaking
of. I dare venture to say, that they
don’t act according to the Precepts of
the Gospel, they neither shew the Wisdom
of the Serpent, nor the Innocency
of the Dove; they have neither so much
Government of themselves, nor so much
Charity for their Neighbours; they
neither take such Care not to scandalize
others, nor to avoid Temptations themselves,
are neither so much above this
World, nor so affected with the next,
as they would certainly be, did the Christian
Religion operate in their Hearts,
did they rightly understand, and sincerely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>practise it, or acted <i>indeed</i> according to
the Spirit of the Gospel.</p>

<p class='c003'>But it is not enough to enter wisely
into this State, Care must be taken of
our Conduct afterwards. A Woman
will not want being admonish’d of her
Duty; the Custom of the World, Oeconomy,
every Thing almost reminds her
of it. Governors do not often suffer
their Subjects to forget Obedience through
their want of demanding it; perhaps
Husbands are but too forward on this
Occasion, and claim their Right oftner
and more imperiously than either Discretion
or good Manners will justify,
and might have both a more chearful
and constant Obedience paid them if
they were not so rigorous in exacting it.
For there is a mutual Stipulation, and
Love, Honour, and Worship, by which
certainly Civility and Respect at least
are meant, are as much the Woman’s
Due, as Love, Honour and Obedience
are the Man’s. And being the Woman
is said to be the weaker Vessel, the Man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>should be more careful not to grieve or
offend her. Since her Reason is suppos’d
to be less, and her Passions stronger than
his, he should not give Occasion to call
that Supposition in Question by his pettish
Carriage and needless Provocations.
Since he is the <i>Man</i>, by which very
word Custom would have us understand
not only greatest Strength of Body, but
even greatest Firmness and Force of
Mind, he should not play the <i>little Master</i>
so much as to expect to be cocker’d,
nor run over to that Side which the Woman
us’d to be rank’d in; for, according
to the Wisdom of the <i>Italians, Will
you? Is spoken to sick Folks</i>.</p>

<p class='c003'>Indeed Subjection, according to the
common Notion of it, is not over easy;
none of us, whether Men or Women,
but have so good an Opinion of our own
Conduct, as to believe we are fit, if not
to direct others, at least to govern our
selves. Nothing but a sound Understanding,
and Grace, the best Improver
of Natural Reason, can correct this Opinion,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>truly humble us, and heartily reconcile
us to Obedience. This bitter
Cup therefore ought to be sweetned as
much as may be; for Authority may be
preserv’d and Government kept inviolable,
without that nauseous Ostentation
of Power, which serves to no End or
Purpose, but to blow up the Pride and
Vanity of those who have it, and to exasperate
the Spirits of such as must truckle
under it.</p>

<p class='c003'>Insolence is never the Effect of
Power but in weak and cowardly Spirits,
who wanting true <i>Merit</i> and Judgment
to support themselves in that Advantageous
Ground on which they stand,
are ever appealing to their Authority,
and making a Shew of it to maintain
their Vanity and Pride. A truly great
Mind, and such as is fit to Govern, tho’
it may stand on its Right with its Equals,
and modestly expect what is due to it
even from its Superiors, yet it never contends
with its Inferiors, nor makes use
of its Superiority but to do them Good.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>So that considering the just Dignity of
Man, his great Wisdom so conspicuous
on all Occasions! the Goodness of his
Temper, and Reasonableness of all his
Commands, which make it a Woman’s
Interest as well as Duty to be observant
and obedient in all Things; that his Prerogative
is settled by an undoubted Right
and the Prescription of many Ages; it
cannot be suppos’d, that he should make
frequent and insolent Claims of an Authority
so well establish’d and us’d with
such Moderation, nor give an impartial
By-stander (could such an one be found)
any Occasion from thence to suspect that
he is inwardly conscious of the Badness
of his Title; Usurpers being always
most desirous of Recognitions, and busy
in imposing Oaths, whereas a Lawful
Prince contents himself with the usual
Methods and Securities.</p>

<p class='c003'>And since Power does naturally puff
up, and he who finds himself exalted,
seldom fails to think he <i>ought</i> to be so,
it is more suitable to a Man’s Wisdom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>and Generosity, to be mindful of his
great Obligations, than to insist on his
Rights and Prerogatives. Sweetness of
Temper and an obliging Carriage are so
justly due to a Wife, that a Husband
who must not be thought to want either
Understanding to know what is fit, nor
Goodness to perform it, can’t be suppos’d
not to shew them. For setting
aside the Hazard of her Person to keep up
his Name and Family, with all the Pains
and Trouble that attend it, which may
well be thought great enough to deserve
all the Respect and Kindness that may
be; setting this aside, though ’tis very
considerable, a Woman has so much the
Disadvantage in <i>most</i>, I was about to
say, in <i>all</i> Things, that she makes a Man
the greatest Compliment in the World
when she condescends to take him <i>for
Better for Worse</i>. She puts her self intirely
in his Power, leaves all that is dear
to her, her Friends and Family, to
espouse his Interests and follow his Fortune,
and makes it her Business and Duty
to please him! What Acknowledgments,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>what Returns can he make? What Gratitude
can be sufficient for such Obligations?
She shews her good Opinion of
him by the great Trust she reposes in
him, and what a Brute must he be who
betrays that Trust, or acts any way unworthy
of it? Ingratitude is one of the
basest Vices, and if a Man’s Soul is sunk
so low as to be guilty of it towards her
who has so generously oblig’d him, and
who so intirely depends on him, if he
can treat her disrespectfully, who has
so fully testified her Esteem of him, she
must have a Stock of Vertue which he
should blush to discern, if she can pay
him that Obedience of which he is so
unworthy.</p>

<p class='c003'>Superiors indeed are too apt to forget
the common Privileges of Mankind;
that their Inferiors share with them the
greatest Benefits, and are as capable as
themselves of enjoying the supreme Good;
that though the Order of the World requires
an <i>Outward</i> Respect and Obedience
from some to others, yet the Mind
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>is free, nothing but Reason can oblige
it, ’tis out of the Reach of the most absolute
Tyrant. Nor will it ever be well
either with those who Rule or those in
Subjection, even from the Throne to
every private Family, till those in Authority
look on themselves as plac’d in
that Station for the Good and Improvement
of their Subjects, and not for their
own Sakes; not as the Reward of their
Merit, or that they may prosecute their
own Desires and fulfil all their Pleasure,
but as the Representatives of God, whom
they ought to imitate in the Justice and
Equity of their Laws, in doing Good
and communicating Blessings to all beneath
them: By which, and not by following
the imperious Dictates of their
own Will, they become truly Great and
Illustrious, and worthily fill their Place.
And the Governed for their Part, ceasing
to envy the Pomp and Name of Authority,
should respect their Governors as
placed in <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>God</span></em>’s stead, and contribute
what they can to ease them of their real
Cares, by a chearful and ready Compliance,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>with their good Endeavours,
and by affording them the Pleasure of
Success in such noble and generous Designs.</p>

<p class='c003'>For, upon a due Estimate, Things are
pretty equally divided; those in Subjection,
as they have a less Glorious, so
they have an easier Task and a less Account
to give; Whereas he who Commands,
has in a great measure the Faults
of others to answer for as well as his own.
’Tis true, he has the Pleasure of doing
more Good than a private Person can,
and shall receive the Reward of it when
Time shall be no more, in Compensation
for the Hazards he runs, the Difficulties
he at present encounters, and the large
Account he is to make hereafter. Which
Pleasure and Reward are highly desirable,
and most worthy our Pursuit; but
they are Motives which such as Usurp
on their Governors, and make them uneasy
in the due Discharge of their Duty,
never propose. As for those other little
Things that move their Envy and Ambition,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>they are of no Esteem with a just
Considerer, nor will such as violently
pursue, find their Account in them.</p>

<p class='c003'>But how can a Man respect his Wife
when he has a contemptible Opinion of
her and her Sex? When from his own
Elevation he looks down on them as
void of Understanding, full of Ignorance
and Passion, so that Folly and a
Woman are equivalent Terms with him?
Can he think there is any Gratitude due
to her whose utmost Services he exacts
as strict Duty? Because she was made to
be a Slave to his Will, and has no
higher End than to Serve and Obey
him? Perhaps we arrogate too much to
our selves, when we say this Material
World was made for our Sakes: That
its Glorious Maker has given us the Use
of it is certain; but when we suppose
any Thing to be made purely for our
Sakes, because we have Dominion over
it, we draw a false Conclusion. As he
who should say the People were made
for the Prince who is set over them,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>would be thought to be out of his Senses
as well as his Politicks. Yet even
allowing that <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>God</span></em>, who made every
Thing in Number, Weight and Measure,
who never acts but for some great
and glorious End, an End agreeable to
His Majesty; allowing that He created
such a Number of Rational Spirits merely
to serve their Fellow Creatures, yet
how are these Lords and Masters help’d
by the Contempt they shew of their poor
humble Vassals? Is it not rather an Hindrance
to that Service they expect, as
being an undeniable and constant Proof
how unworthy they are to receive it?</p>

<p class='c003'>None of <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>God</span></em>’s Creatures, absolutely
consider’d, are in their own Nature contemptible;
the meanest Fly, the poorest
Insect has its Use and Vertue. Contempt
is scarce a Human Passion, one may venture
to say it was not in innocent Man,
for till Sin came into the World, there
was nothing in it to be contemn’d. But
Pride, which makes every Thing serve
its Purposes, wrested this Passion from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>its only Use, so that instead of being an
Antidote against Sin, it is become a
grand Promoter of it, nothing making us
more worthy of that Contempt we shew,
than when, poor, weak, dependent Creatures
as we are! we look down with
Scorn and Disdain on others.</p>

<p class='c003'>There is not a surer Sign of a noble
Mind, a Mind very far advanc’d towards
Perfection, than the being able to
bear Contempt and an unjust Treatment
from one’s Superiors evenly and patiently.
For inward Worth and real Excellency
are the true Ground of Superiority,
and one Person is not in reality better
than another, but as he is more Wise
and Good. But this World being a
Place of Trial, and govern’d by general
Laws, just Retributions being reserv’d
for hereafter, Respect and Obedience
many times become due for Order’s
sake, to those who don’t otherwise
deserve them. Now tho’ Humility keeps
us from over-valuing our selves or viewing
our Merit through a false and magnifying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span><i>Medium</i>, yet it does not put out
our Eyes, it does not, it ought not to
deprive us of that pleasing Sentiment
which attends our Acting as we ought to
Act, which is, as it were, a Foretaste of
Heaven, our present Reward for doing
what is just and fit. And when a Superior
does a mean and unjust thing, as
all Contempt of one’s Neighbour is, and
yet this does not provoke his Inferiors
to refuse that Observance which their
Stations in the World require, they
cannot but have an inward Sense of their
own real Superiority, the other having
no Pretence to it, at the same Time that
they pay him an outward Respect and
Deference, which is such a flagrant Testimony
of the sincerest Love of Order,
as proves their Souls to be of the highest
and noblest Rank.</p>

<p class='c003'>A Man therefore for his own sake,
and to give Evidence that he has a Right
to those Prerogatives he assumes, should
treat Women with a little more Humanity
and Regard than is usually paid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>them. Your whifling Wits may scoff at
them, and what then? It matters not,
for they rally every Thing though ever
so sacred, and rail at the Women commonly
in very good Company. Religion,
its Priests, and those its most constant
and regular Professors, are the usual
Subjects of their manly, mannerly and
surprizing Jests. Surprizing indeed!
not for the Newness of the Thought, the
Brightness of the Fancy, or Nobleness of
Expression, but for the good Assurance
with which such Thread-bare Jests are
again and again repeated. But that your
grave Dons, your learned Men, and,
which is more, your Men of Sense, as
they would be thought, should stoop so
low as to make Invectives against the
Women, forget themselves so much as
to jest with their Slaves, who have neither
Liberty, nor Ingenuity to make
Reprizals; that they should waste their
Time, and debase their good Sense,
which fits them for the most weighty
Affairs, such as are suitable to their profound
Wisdom and exalted Understandings!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>to render those poor Wretches
more ridiculous and odious who are already
in their Opinion sufficiently contemptible,
and find no better Exercise
of their Wit and Satire, than such as are
not worth their Pains, though it were
possible to Reform them, this, this indeed
may justly be wonder’d at!</p>

<p class='c003'>I Know not whether or no Women
are allow’d to have Souls; if they have,
perhaps it is not prudent to provoke
them too much, lest, silly as they are, they
at last recriminate, and then what polite
and well-bred Gentleman, though himself
is concern’d, can forbear taking that
lawful Pleasure, which all who understand
Raillery must taste, when they
find his Jests who insolently began to
peck at his Neighbour, return’d with
Interest upon his own Head? And indeed
Men are too Humane, too Wise,
to venture at it, did they not hope for
this Effect, and expect the Pleasure of
finding their Wit turn to such Account:
For if it be lawful to pry into a Secret,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>this is, without doubt, the whole Design
of those fine Discourses which have
been made against the Women from our
great Fore-Fathers to this present Time!
Generous Man has too much Bravery, he
is too Just and too Good to assault a defenceless
Enemy, and if he did inveigh
against the Women, it was only to do
them Service! For since neither his Care
of their Education, his hearty Endeavours
to improve their Minds, his wholesome
Precepts, nor great Example could
do them good, as his last and kindest Essay,
he resolv’d to try what Contempt
would do, and chose rather to expose
himself by a seeming Want of Justice,
Equity, Ingenuity and Good-nature,
than suffer Women to remain such vain
and insignificant Creatures as they have
hitherto been reckon’d; and truly, Women
are some Degrees beneath what I
have thus far thought them, if they do
not make the best Use of his Kindness,
improve themselves, and, like Christians,
return it.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>Let us see then what is their Part,
what must they do to make the Matrimonial
Yoke tolerable to themselves as
well as pleasing to their Lords and Masters?
That the World is an empty and
deceitful Thing, that those Enjoyments
which appear’d so desirable at a Distance,
which rais’d our Hopes and Expectations
to such a mighty Pitch, which we so
passionately coveted, and so eagerly pursued,
vanish at our first Approach, leaving
nothing behind them but the Folly
of Delusion, and the Pain of disappointed
Hopes, is a common Outcry; and
yet, as common as it is, though we complain
of being deceiv’d this Instant, we
do not fail of contributing to the Cheat
the very next. Though in reality it is
not the World that abuses us, ’tis we
abuse our selves; it is not the Emptiness
of That, but our own false Judgments,
our unreasonable Desires and Expectations
that torment us; for he who exerts
his whole Strength to lift a Straw,
ought not to complain of the Burden,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>but of his own disproportionate Endeavour
which gives him the Pain he feels.
The World affords us all the Pleasure
a sound Judgment can expect from it,
and answers all those Ends and Purposes
for which it was design’d; let us expect
no more than is reasonable, and then
we shall not fail of our Expectations.</p>

<p class='c003'>It is even so in the Case before us;
a Woman who has been taught to think
Marriage her only Preferment, the Sum-Total
of her Endeavours, the Completion
of all her Hopes, that which must
settle and make her Happy in this
World, and very few, in their Youth
especially, carry a Thought steadily to
a greater Distance; She who has seen a
Lover dying at her Feet, and can’t
therefore imagine that he who professes
to receive all his Happiness from her,
can have any other Design or Desire
than to please her; whose Eyes have
been dazled with all the Glitter and
Pomp of a Wedding, and, who hears of
nothing but Joy and Congratulation;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>who is transported with the Pleasure of
being out of Pupillage, and Mistress not
only of her self, but of a Family too:
She who is either so simple or so vain,
as to take her Lover at his Word, either
as to the Praises he gave her, or the
Promises he made for himself; in sum,
she whose Expectation has been rais’d by
Courtship, by all the fine Things that
her Lover, her Governess and Domestick
Flatterers say, will find a terrible Disappointment
when the Hurry is over,
and when she comes calmly to consider
her Condition, and views it no more
under a false Appearance, but as it
truly is.</p>

<p class='c003'>I Doubt in such a View it will not
appear over-desirable, if she regards only
the present State of Things. Hereafter
may make amends for what she
must be prepar’d to suffer here, then
will be her Reward, this is her Time of
Trial, the Season of exercising and improving
her Vertues. A Woman that
is not Mistress of her Passions, that cannot
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>patiently submit, even when Reason
suffers with her, who does not practise
Passive Obedience to the utmost, will
never be acceptable to such an absolute
Sovereign as a Husband. Wisdom ought
to Govern without Contradiction, but
Strength however will be obeyed. There
are but few of those wise Persons who
can be content to be made yet wiser by
Contradiction; the most will have their
<i>Will</i>, and it is right because it is theirs.
Such is the Vanity of Human Nature,
that nothing pleases like an intire Subjection;
what Imperfections won’t a Man
over-look where this is not wanting!
Though we live like Brutes, we would
have Incense offer’d us, that is only due
to Heaven it self, would have an absolute
and blind Obedience paid us by all
over whom we pretend Authority. We
were not made to Idolize one another,
yet the whole Strain of Courtship is little
less than rank Idolatry: But does a Man
intend to give, and not to receive his
Share in this Religious Worship? No
such matter; Pride and Vanity, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>Self-love have their Designs, and if the
Lover is so condescending as to set a
Pattern in the Time of his Addresses, he
is so just as to expect his Wife should
strictly Copy after it all the rest of her
Life.</p>

<p class='c003'>But how can a Woman scruple intire
Subjection, how can she forbear to
admire the Worth and Excellency of the
Superior Sex, if she at all considers it!
Have not all the great Actions that have
been perform’d in the World been done
by Men? Have not they founded Empires
and overturn’d them? Do not
they make Laws and continually repeal
and amend them? Their vast Minds lay
Kingdoms waste, no Bounds or Measures
can be prescrib’d to their Desires.
War and Peace depend on them; they
form Cabals and have the Wisdom and
Courage to get over all the Rubs, the
petty Restraints which Honour and Conscience
may lay in the Way of their desired
Grandeur. What is it they cannot
do? They make Worlds and ruin them,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>form Systems of universal Nature, and
dispute eternally about them; their Pen
gives Worth to the most trifling Controversy;
nor can a Fray be inconsiderable
if they have drawn their Swords in’t.
All that the wise Man pronounces is an
Oracle, and every Word the Witty
speaks, a Jest. It is a Woman’s Happiness
to hear, admire and praise them,
especially if a little Ill-nature keeps them
at any time from bellowing due Applauses
on each other! And if she aspires
no further, she is thought to be in
her proper Sphere of Action; she is as
wise and as good as can be expected
from her!</p>

<p class='c003'>She then who Marries, ought to lay it
down for an indisputable Maxim, that
her Husband must govern absolutely
and intirely, and that she has nothing
else to do but to Please and Obey. She
must not attempt to divide his Authority,
or so much as dispute it; to struggle
with her Yoke will only make it gall
the more, but must believe him Wise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>and Good, and in all respects the best,
at least he must be so to her. She who
can’t do this is no way fit to be a Wife,
she may set up for that peculiar Coronet
the antient Fathers talk’d of, but is
not qualified to receive that great Reward
which attends the eminent Exercise
of Humility and Self-denial, Patience
and Resignation, the Duties that a
Wife is call’d to.</p>

<p class='c003'>But some refractory Woman perhaps
will say, how can this be? Is it possible
for her to believe him Wise and Good,
who by a thousand Demonstrations convinces
her, and all the World, of the contrary?
Did the bare Name of Husband
confer Sense on a Man, and the meer
being in Authority infallibly qualify
him for Government, much might be
done. But since a wise Man and a Husband
are not Terms convertible, and
how loth soever one is to own it, Matter
of Fact won’t allow us to deny, that
the Head many times stands in need of
the Inferior’s Brains to manage it, she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>must beg leave to be excus’d from such
high Thoughts of her Sovereign, and if
she submits to his Power, it is not so
much Reason as Necessity that compels
her.</p>

<p class='c003'>Now of how little Force soever this
Objection may be in other respects, methinks
it is strong enough to prove the
Necessity of a good Education, and that
Men never mistake their true Interest
more than when they endeavour to keep
Women in Ignorance. Could they indeed
deprive them of their Natural
good Sense at the same Time they deny
them the true Improvement of it, they
might compass their End; otherwise
Natural Sense unassisted may run into a
false Track, and serve only to punish
him justly, who would not allow it to
be useful to himself or others. If Man’s
Authority be justly establish’d, the more
Sense a Woman has, the more Reason
she will find to submit to it; if according
to the Tradition of our Fathers,
(who having had <i>Possession</i> of the Pen,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>thought they had also the best <i>Right</i> to
it) Womens Understanding is but small,
and Man’s Partiality adds no Weight to
the Observation, ought not the more
Care to be taken to improve them?
How it agrees with the Justice of Men
we inquire not, but certainly Heaven is
abundantly more Equitable than to injoin
Women the hardest Task, and give
them the least Strength to perform it.
And if Men, learned, wise and discreet
as they are, who have, as is said, all the
Advantages of Nature, and without Controversy,
have, or may have, all the Assistance
of Art, are so far from acquitting
themselves as they ought, from living
according to that Reason and excellent
Understanding they so much boast
of, can it be expected that a Woman
who is reckon’d silly enough in her self,
at least comparatively, and whom Men
take care to make yet more so; can it be
expected that she should constantly perform
so difficult a Duty as intire Subjection,
to which corrupt Nature is so
averse?</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>If the great and wise <i>Cato</i>, a <i>Man</i>, a
Man of no ordinary Firmness and Strength
of Mind, a Man who was esteem’d as an
Oracle, and by the Philosophers and
great Men of his Nation equal’d even to
the Gods themselves; If he, with all his
Stoical Principles, was not able to bear
the Sight of a triumphant Conqueror,
(who perhaps would have insulted, and
perhaps would not) but out of a Cowardly
Fear of an Insult, ran to Death, to secure
him from it; can it be thought that
an ignorant weak Woman should have
Patience to bear a continual Outrage
and Insolence all the Days of her Life?
Unless you will suppose her a <i>very Ass</i>,
but then remember what the <i>Italians</i> say,
to quote them once more, since being
<i>very</i> Husbands they may be presum’d to
have some Authority in this Case, <i>An
Ass, though slow, if provok’d, will kick</i>.</p>

<p class='c003'>We never observe, or perhaps make
Sport, with the ill Effects of a bad Education,
till it comes to touch us home in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>the ill Conduct of a Sister, a Daughter,
or Wife. Then the Women must be
blam’d, their Folly is exclaim’d against,
when all this while it was the wise Man’s
Fault, who did not set a better Guard
on those, who, according to him, stand
in so much need of one. A young Gentleman,
as a celebrated Author tells us,
ought above all Things to be acquainted
with the State of the World, the
Ways and Humours, the Follies, the
Cheats, the Faults of the Age he is fallen
into; he should by degrees be inform’d
of the Vice in Fashion, and warn’d of
the Application and Design of those who
will make it their Business to corrupt
him, should be told the Arts they use,
and the Trains they lay, be prepar’d to
be Shock’d by some, and Caress’d by
others; warn’d who are like to oppose,
who to mislead, who to undermine, and
who to serve him. He should be instructed
how to know and distinguish
them, where he should let them see, and
when dissemble the Knowledge of them
and their Aims and Workings. Our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>Author is much in the right, and not to
disparage any other Accomplishments
which are useful in their Kind, this will
turn to more Account than any Language
or Philosophy, Art or Science, or
any other Piece of Good-breeding and
fine Education that can be taught him,
which are no otherwise excellent than
as they contribute to this, as this does
above all Things to the making him a
wise, a vertuous and useful Man.</p>

<p class='c003'>And it is not less necessary that a
young Lady should receive the like Instructions,
whether or no her Temptations
be fewer, her Reputation and Honour
however are to be more nicely
preserv’d; they may be ruin’d by a little
Ignorance or Indiscretion, and then
though she has kept her Innocence, and
so is secur’d as to the next World, yet
she is in a great measure lost to this. A
Woman cannot be too watchful, too apprehensive
of her Danger, nor keep at
too great a Distance from it, since Man,
whose Wisdom and Ingenuity is so much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>Superior to hers! condescends for his
Interest sometimes, and sometimes by
way of Diversion, to lay Snares for her.
For though all Men are <i>Virtuosi</i>, Philosophers
and Politicians, in comparison of
the ignorant and illiterate Women, yet
they don’t all pretend to be Saints, and
’tis no great Matter to them, if Women,
who were born to be their Slaves, be
now and then ruin’d for their Entertainment.</p>

<p class='c003'>But according to the rate that young
Women are Educated, according to the
Way their Time is spent, they are destin’d<a id='t89'></a>
to Folly and Impertinence, to say
no worse, and, which is yet more inhuman,
they are blam’d for that ill Conduct
they are not suffer’d to avoid, and
reproach’d for those Faults they are in a
Manner forc’d into; so that if Heaven
has bestowed any Sense on them, no
other Use is made of it, than to leave
them without Excuse. So much, and
no more, of the World is shewn them,
than serves to weaken and corrupt their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>Minds, to give them wrong Notions,
and busy them in mean Pursuits; to disturb,
not to regulate their Passions; to
make them timorous and dependant, and,
in a Word, fit for nothing else but to
act a Farce for the Diversion of their
Governors.</p>

<p class='c003'>Even Men themselves improve no
otherwise than according to the Aim
they take, and the End they propose;
and he whose Designs are but little and
mean, will be the same himself. Tho’
Ambition, as ’tis usually understood, is
a foolish, not to say a base and pitiful
Vice, yet the Aspirings of the Soul after
true Glory are so much its Nature, that
it seems to have forgot it self, and to
degenerate, if it can forbear; and perhaps
the great Secret of Education lies
in affecting the Soul with a lively Sense
of what is truly its Perfection, and exciting
the most ardent Desires after it.</p>

<p class='c003'>But, alas! what poor Woman is ever
taught that she should have a higher Design
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>than to get her a Husband? Heaven
will fall in of course; and if she makes
but an Obedient and Dutiful Wife, she
cannot miss of it. A Husband indeed is
thought by both Sexes so very valuable,
that scarce a Man who can keep himself
clean and make a Bow, but thinks
he is good enough to pretend to any
Woman; no matter for the Difference of
Birth or Fortune, a Husband is such a
Wonder-working Name as to make an
Equality, or something more, whenever
it is obtain’d.</p>

<p class='c003'>And indeed, were there no other
Proof of Masculine Wisdom, and what a
much greater Portion of Ingenuity falls
to the Men than to the Women’s Share,
the Address, the Artifice, and Management
of an humble Servant were a sufficient
Demonstration. What good Conduct
does he shew! what Patience exercise!
what Subtilty leave untry’d! what
Concealment of his Faults! what Parade
of his Vertues! what Government of his
Passions! How deep is his Policy in laying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>his Designs at so great a Distance,
and working them up by such little Accidents!
How indefatigable is his Industry,
and how constant his Watchfulness
not to slip any Opportunity that may in
the least contribute to his Design! What
a handsome Set of Disguises and Pretences
is he always furnish’d with! How conceal’d
does he lie! how little pretend,
till he is sure that his Plot will take!
And at the same Time that he nourishes
the Hope of being Lord and Master, appears
with all the Modesty and Submission
of an humble and unpretending Admirer!</p>

<p class='c003'>Can a Woman then be too much upon
her Guard? Can her Prudence and
Foresight, her early Caution, be reckon’d
unnecessary Suspicion, or ill-bred Reserve
by any but those whose Designs they
prevent, and whose Interest it is to declaim
against them? It being a certain
Maxim with the Men, though Policy or
good Breeding won’t allow them to
avow it always, that the Women were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>made for their Sakes and Service, and
are in all respects their Inferiors, especially
in Understanding; so that all the
Compliments they make, all the Address
and Complaisance they use, all the Kindness
they profess, all the Service they
pretend to pay, has no other Meaning,
no other End, than to get the poor Woman
into their Power, to govern her according
to their Discretion. This is all
pure Kindness indeed, and therefore no
Woman has Reason to be offended with
it; for, considering how much she is
expos’d in her own, and how safe in
their Keeping, ’tis the wisest Thing she
can do to put her self under Protection!
And then if they have a tolerable Opinion
of her Sense, and not their Vanity,
but some better Principle disposes them
to do something out of the Way, and
to appear more generous than the rest of
their Sex, they’ll condescend to dictate
to her, and impart some of their Prerogative,
Books and Learning. ’Tis fit
indeed, that she should intirely depend
on their Choice, and walk with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>Crutches they are pleas’d to lend her;
and if she is furnished out with some
Notions to set her a prating, I should
have said, to make her entertaining, and
the Fiddle of the Company, her Tutor’s
Time was not ill bestowed: And it were
a diverting Scene to see her stript, like the
<i>Jay</i>, of her borrowed Feathers, but he,
good Man, has not ill Nature enough
to take Pleasure in it! You may accuse
him, perhaps, for giving so much Encouragement
to a Woman’s Vanity, but
your Accusation is groundless, Vanity
being a Disease the Sex will always be
guilty of; nor is it a Reproach to them,
since Men of Learning and Sense are
over-run with it.</p>

<p class='c003'>But there are few Women whose
Understandings are worth the Management,
their Estates are much more capable
of Improvement. No Woman,
much less a Woman of Fortune, is ever
fit to be her own Mistress, and he who
has not the Vanity to think what much
finer Things he could perform, had he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>the Management of her Fortune; or so
much Partiality and Self-love, as to fancy
it can’t be better bestow’d than in making
his; will yet be so honest and humble,
as to think that ’tis fit she should take
his Assistance, as Steward at least. For
the good Man aspires no further, he
would only take the Trouble of her Affairs
off her Hand; and the Sense of her
Condescension and his great Obligations,
will for ever secure him against acting
like a Lord and Master.</p>

<p class='c003'>The Steps to Folly, as well as Sin, are
gradual, and almost imperceptible, and
when we are once on the Decline, we go
down without taking Notice on’t; were
it not for this, one could not account for
those strange unequal Marriages we too
often see. For there was a Time, no
doubt, when a Woman could not have
bore the very Thought of what she has
been afterwards betray’d into; it would
have appear’d as shocking to her, as it
always does to other People; and had a
Man been so impolitick as to discover
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>the least Intimation of such a Design, he
had given her a sufficient Antidote
against it. This your wise Men are well
satisfied of, and understand their own
Interest too well to let their Design go
bare-fac’d, for that would effectually put
a Bar to their Success. So innocent are
they, that they had not the least Thought
at first of what their good Fortune afterwards
leads them to! They would draw
upon him, (if they wear a Sword) or
fly in her Face who should let fall the
least Hint that they had such Intentions;
and this very Eagerness to avoid the
Suspicion, is a shrewd Sign that there is
Occasion for’t.</p>

<p class='c003'>But who shall dare to shew the Lady
her Danger, when will it be seasonable
to give her friendly Notice? If you do
it ere she is resolv’d, though with all
the Friendship and Tenderness imaginable,
she will hardly forgive the Affront,
or bear the Provocation; you
offer her an Outrage by entertaining such
a Thought, and ’tis ten to one if you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>are not afterwards accus’d for putting in
her Head what otherwise she could ne’er
have dreamt of. And when no direct
Proof can be offer’d, when matter of
Prudence is the only Thing in Question,
every Body has so good an Opinion of
their own Understanding, as to think
their own Way the best. And when
she has her Innocence and fair Intentions
to oppose your Fears and Surmises, and
you cannot pretend to wish her better
than she does her self, to be more disinterested
and diligent in your Watchfulness,
or to see farther in what so nearly
concerns her, what can be done?
Her Ruin is commonly too far advanc’d
to be prevented, ere you can in Good-breeding
reach out a Hand to help her.
For if the Train has took, if she is intangled
in the Snare, if Love, or rather
a blind unreasonable Fondness, which
usurps the Name of that noble Passion,
has gain’d on her, Reason and Persuasion
may as properly be urg’d to the
Folks in <i>Bethlem</i>, as to her. Tell her
of this World, she is got above it, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>has no Regard to its impertinent Censures;
tell her of the next, she laughs
at you, and will never be convinc’d that
Actions which are not expresly forbid
can be Criminal, though they proceed
from, and must necessarily be reduc’d
to ill Principles, though they give Offence,
are of ill Example, injure our
Reputation, which, next to our Innocence,
we are obliged, as Christians, to
take the greatest Care of; and, in a
Word, do more Mischief than we can
readily imagine. Tell her of her own
Good, you appear yet more ridiculous,
for who can judge of her Happiness but
her self? And whilst our Hearts are
violently set upon any thing, there is
no convincing us that we shall ever be
of another Mind. Our Passions want no
Advocates, they are always furnish’d
with plausible Pretences, and those very
Prejudices, which gave rise to this unreasonable
Passion, will for certain give
her Obstinacy enough to justify and continue
in it. Besides, some are so ill advis’d
as to think to support one Indiscretion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>with another; they would not
have it thought they have made a false
Step, in once giving Countenance to
that which is not fit to be continued.
Or perhaps the Lady might be willing
enough to throw off the Intruder at first,
but wanted Courage to get above the
Fear of his Calumnies, and the longer
she suffers him to buz about her, she will
find it the harder to get rid of his Importunities.
By all which it appears,
that she who really intends to be secure,
must keep at the greatest Distance from
Danger, she must not grant the <i>least</i> Indulgence,
where such ill Uses will be
made of it.</p>

<p class='c003'>And since the Case is so, That Woman
can never be in Safety who allows
a Man Opportunity to betray her. Frequent
Conversation does for certain produce
either Aversion or Liking, and
when ’tis once come to Liking, it depends
on the Man’s Generosity not to
improve it farther, and where can one
find an Instance that this is any Security?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>There are very many indeed which
shew it is none. How sensible soever a
Woman may appear of another’s Indiscretion,
if she will tread in the same
Steps, though but for a little Way, she
gives us no Assurance that she will not
fall into the same Folly; she may perhaps
intend very well, but she puts it
past her Power to fulfil her good Intentions.
Even those who have forfeited
their Discretion, the most valuable Jewel
next to their Vertue, and without which
Vertue it self is but very weak and faint,
’tis like, were once as well resolv’d as
she; they had the very same Thoughts,
they made the same Apologies, and their
Resentment would have been every whit
as great against those who could have
imagined they should so far forget themselves.</p>

<p class='c003'>It were endless to reckon up the divers
Stratagems Men use to catch their
Prey, their different Ways of insinuating,
which vary with Circumstances, and the
Lady’s Temper, but how unfairly, how
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>basely soever they proceed, when the
Prey is once caught, it passes for lawful
Prize, and other Men having the same
Hopes and Projects, see nothing to find
Fault with, but that it was not their
own good Fortune. They may exclaim
against it perhaps in a Lady’s Hearing,
but it is only to keep themselves from
being suspected, and to give the better
Colour to their own Designs. Sometimes
a Woman is cajol’d, and sometimes
hector’d, she is seduc’d to love a Man,
or aw’d into a Fear of him: He defends
her Honour against another, or assumes
the Power of blasting it himself; was
willing to pass for one of no Consequence
till he could make himself considerable
at her Cost. He might be admitted
at first to be <i>her Jest</i>, but he
carries on the Humour so far till he
makes her <i>his</i>; he will either entertain
or serve her as Occasion offers, and some
Way or other gets himself intrusted with
her Fortune, her Fame, or her Soul.
Allow him but a frequent and free Conversation,
and there’s no manner of Question
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>but that his Ingenuity and Application,
will, at one Time or other, get
the Ascendant over her.</p>

<p class='c003'>And generally the more humble and
undesigning a Man appears, the more
improbable it looks that he should dare
to pretend, the greater Caution should be
us’d against him. A bold Address and
good Assurance may sometimes, but does
not always, take. To a Woman of
Sense an artificial Modesty and Humility
is a thousand times more dangerous, for
he only draws back to receive the more
Encouragement, and she regards not
what Advances she makes towards him,
who seems to understand himself and the
World so well as to be incapable of making
an ill Use of them. Would it not
be unreasonable, and a Piece of Ill-breeding,
to be shy of him who has no
Pretensions, or only such as are Just and
Modest? What Hurt in a Visit? Or what
if Visits grow a little more frequent?
The Man has so much Discernment, as
to relish her Wit and Humour, and can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>she do less than be Partial to him who
is so just to her? He strives to please
and to render himself agreeable, or necessary,
perhaps, and whoever will make
it his Business, may find Ways enough
to do it. For they know but little of
Human Nature, they never consulted
their own Hearts, who are not sensible
what Advances a well-manag’d Flattery
makes, especially from a Person of whose
Wit and Sense one has a good Opinion.
His Wit at first recommends his Flatteries,
and these, in Requital, set off his
Wit; and she who has been us’d to
this high-season’d Diet, will scarce ever
relish another Conversation.</p>

<p class='c003'>Having got thus far, to be sure he
is not wanting to his good Fortune, but
drives on to an Intimacy, or what they
are pleas’d, now a-days, though very
unjustly, to call a Friendship; all is safe
under this sacred Character, which sets
them above little Aims and mean Designs.
A Character that must be conducted
with the nicest Honour, allows
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>the greatest Trusts, leads to the highest
Improvements, is attended with the purest
Pleasures and most rational Satisfaction.
And what if the malicious World, envious
of his Happiness, should take Offence
at it, since he has taken all due
Precautions, such unjust and ill-natur’d
Censures are not to be regarded; for his
Part the Distance that is between them
checks all aspiring Desires, but her Conversation
is what he must not, cannot
want: Life is insipid, and not to be endur’d
without it; and he is too much
the Lady’s Friend, has too just a Value
for her, to entertain a Thought to her
Disadvantage.</p>

<p class='c003'>Now if once it is come to this, <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>God</span></em>
help the poor Woman! for not much
Service can be done her by any of her
Friends on Earth. That Pretender, to
be sure, will be the Darling, he will
worm out every other Person, though
ever so kind and disinterested. For tho’
true Friends will endeavour to please in
order to serve, their Complaisance never
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>goes so far as to prove injurious; the
beloved Fault is what they chiefly strike
at, and this the Flatterer always sooths;
so that at last he becomes the most acceptable
Company, and they who are
conscious of their own Integrity, are not
apt to bear such an unjust Distinction,
nor is it by this Time to any Purpose to
remonstrate the Danger of such an Intimacy.
When a Man, and for certain
much more when a Woman, is fallen into
this Toil, that is, when either have
been so unwary and indiscreet as to let
another find out by what Artifices he
may manage their Self-love, and draw
it over to his Party, ’tis too late for anyone
who is really their Friend, to break
the Snare and disabuse them.</p>

<p class='c003'>Neither Sex cares to deny themselves
that which pleases, especially
when they think they may innocently
indulge it; and nothing pleases more
than the being Admir’d and Humour’d.
We may be told of the Danger, and
shewn the Fall of others, but though
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>their Misfortunes are ever so often or so
lively represented to us, we are all so
well assur’d of our own good Conduct,
as to believe it will bring us safe off
those Rocks on which others have been
Shipwreck’d. We suppose it in our
Power to shorten the Line of our Liberty
whenever we think fit, not considering
that the farther we run, we shall
be the more unwilling to retreat, and
unable to judge when a Retreat is necessary.
A Woman does not know that
she is more than half lost when she admits
of these Suggestions; that those Arguments
she brings for continuing a
Man’s Conversation, prove only that she
ought to have quitted it sooner; that
Liking insensibly converts to Love, and
that when she admits a Man to be her
Friend, ’tis his Fault if he does not make
himself her Husband.</p>

<p class='c003'>And if Men, even the Modestest and
the Best, are only in pursuit of their own
Designs, when they pretend to do the
Lady Service; if the Honour they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>would seem to do her, tends only to lead
her into an imprudent, and therefore a
dishonourable Action; and they have
all that good Opinion of themselves as
to take every thing for Encouragement,
so that she who goes beyond a bare Civility,
though she meant no more than
Respect, will find it interpreted a Favour,
and made ill Use of, (for Favours, how
innocent soever, never turn to a Lady’s
Advantage) what Shadow of a Pretence
can a Woman have for admitting an Intimacy
with a Man, whose Principles
are known to be Loose, and his Practices
Licentious? can she expect to be safe
with him who has ruin’d others, and
by the very same Methods he takes with
her? If an Intimacy with a Man of a
fair Character gives Offence, with a Man
of an ill one, ’tis doubly and trebly
scandalous. And suppose neither her
Fortune nor Beauty can tempt him, he
has his ill-natur’d Pleasure in destroying
that Vertue he will not practise, or if
that can’t be done, in blasting the Reputation
of it at least, and in making
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>the World believe he has made a Conquest,
though he has found a Foil.</p>

<p class='c003'>If the Man be the Woman’s Inferior,
besides all the Dangers formerly mention’d,
and those just now taken Notice
of, she gives such a Countenance to his
Vices, as renders her in great measure,
Partaker in them; and, it can scarce be
thought in such Circumstances, a Woman
could like the Man if she were not
reconcil’d to his Faults. Is he her
Equal, and no unsuitable Match, if his
Designs are fair, why don’t they Marry,
since they are so well pleas’d with each
other’s Conversation, which in this State
only can be frequently and safely allow’d?
Is he her Better, and she hopes,
by catching him, to make her Fortune,
alas! the poor Woman is neither acquainted
with the World nor her self;
she neither knows her own Weakness,
nor his Treachery, and though he gives
her ever so much Encouragement to
this vain Hope, ’tis only in order to accomplish
her Ruin. To be sure the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>more Freedom she allows, the more she
lessens his Esteem, and that’s not likely
to increase a real, though it may a pretended
Kindness; she ought to fly, if
she would have him pursue, the strictest
Vertue and Reserve being the only Way
to secure him.</p>

<p class='c003'>Religion and Reputation are so
sure a Guard, such a Security to poor
defenceless Woman, that whenever a
Man has ill Designs on her, he is sure to
make a Breach into one or both of these,
by endeavouring either to corrupt her
Principles, to make her less strict in Devotion,
or to lessen her Value of a fair
Reputation, and would persuade her,
that less than she imagines will secure
her as to the next World, and that not
much Regard is to be given to the Censures
of this. Or if this be too bold at
first, and will not pass with her, he has
another Way to make even her Love to
Vertue contribute to its Ruin, by persuading
her it never shines as it ought,
unless it is expos’d, and that she has no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>Reason to boast of her Vertue unless she
has try’d it. An Opinion of the worst
Consequence that may be, and the most
mischievous to a Woman, because it is
calculated to feed her Vanity, and tends
indeed to her utter Ruin. For, can it
be fit to rush into Temptations, when
we are taught every Day to pray against
them? If the Trials of our Vertue render
it illustrious, ’tis such Trials as Heaven
is pleas’d to send us, not those of our
own seeking. It holds true of both
Sexes, that next to the Divine Grace a
modest Distrust of themselves is their
best Security, none being so often and
so shamefully foil’d, as those who depend
most on their own Strength and
Resolution.</p>

<p class='c003'>As to the Opinion of the World, tho’
one cannot say ’tis always just, yet generally
it has a Foundation, great Regard
is to be paid to it, and very good
Use to be made of it. Others <i>may</i> be in
Fault for passing their Censures, but we
certainly <i>are</i> so, if we give them any the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>least just Occasion. And since Reputation
is not only one of the Rewards of
Vertue, that which always ought, and
generally does attend it, but also a Guard
against Evil, an Inducement to Good,
and a great Instrument in the Hand of
the Wife to promote the common Cause
of Vertue; the being Prodigal of the
one, looks as if we set no great Value
on the other, and she who abandons her
good Name, is not like to preserve her
Innocence.</p>

<p class='c003'>A Woman therefore can never have
too nice a Sense of Honour, provided
she does not prefer it before her Duty;
she can never be too careful to secure
her Character, not only from the Suspicion
of a Crime, but even from the
Shadow of an Indiscretion. ’Tis well
worth her while to renounce the most
Entertaining, and, what some perhaps,
will call the most Improving Company,
rather than give the World a just Occasion
of Suspicion or Censure. For besides
the Injury that is done Religion,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>which enjoins us to avoid the very Appearance
of Evil, and to do nothing but
what is of good Report, she puts her
self too much in a Man’s Power, who
will run such a Risque for his Conversation,
and expresses such a Value for him,
as cannot fail of being made use of to do
her a Mischief.</p>

<p class='c003'>Preserve your Distance then, keep
out of the Reach of Danger, fly if you
would be safe, be sure to be always on
the Reserve, not such as is Morose and
Affected, but Modest and Discreet, your
Caution cannot be too great, nor your
Foresight reach too far; there’s nothing,
or what is next to nothing, a little Amusement
and entertaining Conversation,
lost by this, but all is hazarded by the
other. A Man understands his own
Merit too well to lose his Time in a
Woman’s Company, were it not to divert
himself at her Cost, to turn her into
a Jest, or something worse. And
where-ever you see great Assiduities, when
a Man insinuates into the Diversions and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>Humours of the Lady, liking and admiring
whatever she does, though at the
same Time he seems to keep a due Distance,
or rather exceeds in the profoundest
Respect; Respect being all he
dare at present pretend to: when a more
than ordinary Deference is paid; when
something particular appears in the Look
and Address, and such an Obsequiousness
in every Action, as nothing could
engage a Man to, who never forgets the
Superiority of his Sex, but a Hope to be
observ’d in his Turn: Then, whatever
the Inequality be, and how sensible soever
he seems to be of it, the Man has
for certain his Engines at work, the Mine
is ready to be sprung on the first Opportunity,
and ’tis well if it be not too late
to prevent the poor Lady’s Ruin.</p>

<p class='c003'>To wind up this Matter; If a Woman
were duly principled, and taught to
know the World, especially the true
Sentiments that Men have of her, and
the Traps they lay for her under so
many gilded Compliments, and such a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>seemingly great Respect, that Disgrace
would be prevented which is brought
upon too many Families; Women would
Marry more discreetly, and demean
themselves better in a married State, than
some People say they do. The Foundation,
indeed, ought to be laid deep
and strong, she should be made a good
Christian, and understand why she is so,
and then she will be every thing else
that is Good. Men need keep no Spies
on a Woman’s Conduct, need have no
Fear of her Vertue, or so much as of her
Prudence and Caution, were but a due
Sense of true Honour and Vertue awaken’d
in her; were her Reason excited
and prepared to consider the Sophistry of
those Temptations which would persuade
her from her Duty; and were she
put in a way to know that it is both her
Wisdom and Interest to observe it: she
would then duly examine and weigh all
the Circumstances, the Good and Evil
of a married State, and not be surprized
with unforeseen Inconveniencies, and
either never consent to be a Wife, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>make a good one when she does. This
would shew her what Human Nature <i>is</i>,
as well as what it <i>ought</i> to be, and teach
her not only what she may justly expect,
but what she must be content with;
would enable her to cure some Faults,
and patiently to suffer what she cannot
cure.</p>

<p class='c003'>Indeed nothing can assure Obedience,
and render it what it ought to be,
but the Conscience of Duty, the paying
it for <span class='sc'>God’s</span> sake. Superiors don’t rightly
understand their own Interest when
they attempt to put out their Subjects
Eyes to keep them Obedient. A blind
Obedience is what a Rational Creature
should never pay, nor would such an
one receive it, did he rightly understand
its Nature. For Human Actions are no
otherwise valuable, than as they are conformable
to Reason; but a blind Obedience
is an Obeying <i>without Reason</i>,
for ought we know, <i>against it</i>. <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>God</span></em>
himself does not require our Obedience
at this rate; he lays before us the Goodness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>and Reasonableness of his Laws,
and were there any thing in them whose
Equity we could not readily comprehend,
yet we have this clear and sufficient
Reason, on which, to found our
Obedience, that nothing but what’s just
and fit, can be enjoin’d by a Just, a
Wise, and Gracious <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>God</span></em>; but this is a
Reason will never hold in respect of
Mens Commands, unless they can prove
themselves Infallible, and consequently
Impeccable too.</p>

<p class='c003'>It is therefore very much a Man’s
Interest, that Women should be good
Christians; for in this, as in every other
Instance, he who does his Duty, finds his
own Account in it. Duty and true Interest
are one and the same Thing, and
he who thinks otherwise is to be pitied
for being so much in the Wrong: But
what can be more the Duty of the Head,
than to instruct and improve those who
are under Government? She will freely
leave him the quiet Dominion of this
World, whose Thoughts and Expectations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>are plac’d on the next. A Prospect
of Heaven, and that only, will cure that
Ambition which all generous Minds are
fill’d with, not by taking it away, but
by placing it on a right Object. She
will discern a Time when her Sex shall
be no Bar to the best Employments, the
highest Honour; a Time when that Distinction,
now so much us’d to her Prejudice,
shall be no more; but, provided
she is not wanting to her self, her Soul
shall shine as bright as the greatest Heroe’s.
This is a true, and indeed, the
only Consolation; this makes her a sufficient
Compensation for all the Neglect
and Contempt the ill-grounded Customs
of the World throw on her; for all the
Injuries brutal Power may do her, and
is a sufficient Cordial to support her Spirits,
be her Lot in this World what it
may.</p>

<p class='c003'>But some sage Persons may, perhaps
object, that were Women allow’d
to improve themselves, and not, amongst
other Discouragements, driven back by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>wise Jests and Scoffs that are put upon a
Woman of Sense or Learning, a Philosophical
Lady, as she is call’d by way of
Ridicule; they would be too wise, and
too good for the Men: I grant it, for
vicious and foolish Men. Nor is it to
be wonder’d that He is afraid he should
not be able to Govern them were their
Understandings improv’d, who is resolv’d
not to take too much Pains with
his own. But these, ’tis to be hoped,
are no very considerable Number, the
Foolish at least; and therefore this is so
far from being an Argument against
Womens Improvement, that it is a strong
one for it, if we do but suppose the Men
to be as capable of Improvement as the
Women; but much more, if, according
to Tradition, we believe they have
greater Capacities. This, if any thing,
would stir them up to be what they
ought, and not permit them to waste
their Time and abuse their Faculties in
the Service of their irregular Appetites
and unreasonable Desires, and so let
poor contemptible Women, who have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>been their Slaves, excel them in all that
is truly excellent. This would make
them Blush at employing an immortal
Mind no better than in making Provision
for the Flesh to fulfil the Lusts
thereof, since Women, by a wiser Conduct,
have brought themselves to such
a Reach of Thought, to such Exactness
of Judgment, such Clearness and Strength
of Reasoning, such Purity and Elevation
of Mind, such Command of their Passions,
such Regularity of Will and Affection,
and, in a Word, to such a Pitch
of Perfection, as the Human Soul is capable
of attaining in this Life by the
Grace of <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>God</span></em>; such true Wisdom, such
real Greatness, as though it does not
qualify them to make a Noise in this
World, to found or overturn Empires,
yet it qualifies them for what is infinitely
better, a Kingdom that cannot be
mov’d, an incorruptible Crown of Glory.</p>

<p class='c003'>Besides, it were ridiculous to suppose,
that a Woman, were she ever so
much improv’d, could come near the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>topping Genius of the Men, and therefore
why should they envy or discourage
her? Strength of Mind goes along with
Strength of Body, and ’tis only for some
odd Accidents which Philosophers have
not yet thought worth while to enquire
into, that the sturdiest Porter is not the
wisest Man! As therefore the Men have
the Power in their Hands, so there’s no
Dispute of their having the Brains to
manage it! Can we suppose there is such
a Thing as good Judgment and Sense
upon Earth, if it is not to be found
among them: Do not they, generally
speaking, do all the great Actions and
considerable Business of this World, and
leave that of the next to the Women?
Their Subtlety in forming Cabals and
laying deep Designs, their Courage and
Conduct in breaking through all Tyes,
sacred and civil, to effect them, not only
advances them to the Post of Honour,
and keeps them securely in it for twenty
or thirty Years, but gets them a Name,
and conveys it down to Posterity for
some Hundreds; and who would look
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>any further? Justice and Injustice are
administred by their Hands, Courts and
Schools are fill’d with these Sages; ’tis
Men who dispute for Truth, as well as
Men who argue against it: Histories are
writ by them; they recount each other’s
great Exploits, and have always done
so. All famous Arts have their Original
from Men, even from the Invention of
Guns, to the Mystery of good Eating.
And to shew that nothing is beneath
their Care, any more than above their
Reach, they have brought <i>Gaming</i> to
an Art and Science, and a more Profitable
and Honourable one too, than any
of those that us’d to be call’d <i>Liberal</i>!
Indeed, what is it they can’t perform,
when they attempt it? The Strength of
their Brains shall be every whit as conspicuous
at their Cups, as in a Senate-House,
and, when they please, they can
make it pass for as sure a Mark of Wisdom,
to drink deep, as to reason profoundly;
a greater Proof of Courage,
and consequently of Understanding, to
dare the Vengeance of Heaven it self,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>than to stand the Raillery of some of the
worst of their Fellow Creatures!</p>

<p class='c003'>Again, it may be said, If a Wife’s
Case be as it is here represented, it is
not good for a Woman to marry, and
so there’s an End of Human Race. But
this is no fair Consequence, for all that
can justly be inferr’d from hence, is,
that a Woman has no mighty Obligations
to the Man who makes Love to
her; she has no Reason to be fond of
being a Wife, or to reckon it a Piece of
Preferment when she is taken to be a
Man’s Upper-Servant; it is no Advantage
to her in this World; if rightly
manag’d it may prove one as to the
next. For she who marries purely to
do good, to educate Souls for Heaven,
who can be so truly mortified as to lay
aside her own Will and Desires, to pay
such an intire Submission for Life, to
one whom she cannot be sure will always
deserve it, does certainly perform
a more Heroick Action, than all the famous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>Masculine Heroes can boast of,
she suffers a continual Martyrdom to
bring Glory to <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>God</span></em>, and Benefit to
Mankind; which Consideration, indeed,
may carry her through all Difficulties,
I know not what else can, and engage
her to Love him who proves perhaps
so much worse than a Brute, as to make
this Condition yet more grievous than it
needed to be. She has need of a strong
Reason, of a truly Christian and well-temper’d
Spirit, of all the Assistance the
best Education can give her, and ought
to have some good Assurance of her own
Firmness and Vertue, who ventures on
such a Trial; and for this Reason ’tis
less to be wonder’d at that Women
marry off in haste, for perhaps if they
took Time to consider and reflect upon
it, they seldom would marry.</p>

<p class='c003'>To conclude. Perhaps I’ve said more
than most Men will thank me for; I
cannot help it, for how much soever I
may be their Friend and humble Servant,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>I am more a Friend to Truth.
Truth is strong, and some time or other
will prevail; nor is it for their Honour,
and therefore one would think not for
their Interest, to be partial to themselves
and unjust to others. They may
fancy I have made some Discoveries,
which, like <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Arcana Imperii</span></i>, ought to be
kept secret; but, in good earnest, I do
them more Honour than to suppose their
lawful Prerogatives need any mean Arts
to support them. If they have usurp’d,
I love Justice too much to wish Success
and Continuance to Usurpations, which,
though submitted to out of Prudence,
and for Quietness sake, yet leave everybody
free to regain their lawful Right
whenever they have Power and Opportunity.
I don’t say that Tyranny <i>ought</i>,
but we find in <i>Fact</i>, that it provokes
the Oppress’d to throw off even a lawful
Yoke that fits too heavy: And if he
who is freely elected, after all his fair
Promises, and the fine Hopes he rais’d,
proves a Tyrant, the Consideration that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>he was one’s own Choice, will not render
one more Submissive and Patient, but I
fear, more Refractory. For though it
is very unreasonable, yet we see ’tis the
Course of the World, not only to return
Injury for Injury, but Crime for Crime;
both Parties indeed are Guilty, but the
Aggressors have a double Guilt, they
have not only their own, but their
Neighbour’s Ruin to answer for.</p>

<p class='c003'>As to the Female Reader, I hope she
will allow I’ve endeavoured to do her
Justice; not betray’d her Cause as her
Advocates usually do, under Pretence of
defending it. A Practice too mean for
any to be guilty of who have the least
Sense of Honour, and who do any more
than meerly pretend to it. I think I
have held the Balance even, and not
being conscious of Partiality, I ask no
Pardon for it. To plead for the Oppress’d,
and to defend the Weak, seem’d
to me a generous Undertaking; for
though it may be secure, ’tis not always
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>Honourable, to run over to the
strongest Party. And if she infers from
what has been said, that Marriage is a
very happy State for Men, if they think
fit to make it so; that they govern the
World, they have Prescription on their
Side; Women are too weak to dispute
it with them, therefore they, as all other
Governors, are most, if not only, accountable
for what’s amiss; for whether
other Governments in their Original,
were or were not confer’d according
to the Merit of the Person, yet certainly
in this Case, if Heaven has appointed
the Man to govern, it has Qualified
him for it: So far I agree with
her: But if she goes on to infer, that
therefore, if a Man has not these Qualifications,
where is his Right? That if
he misemploys, he abuses it? And if he
abuses, according to modern Deduction,
he forfeits it, I must leave her there. A
peaceable Woman, indeed, will not carry
it so far, she will neither question her
Husband’s Right, nor his Fitness to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>govern, but how? Not as an absolute
Lord and Master, with an arbitrary and
tyrannical Sway, but as Reason governs
and conducts a Man, by proposing
what is just and fit. And the Man who
acts according to that Wisdom he assumes,
who would have that Superiority
he pretends to, acknowledged just, will
receive no Injury by any thing that has
been offered here. A Woman will value
Him the more who is so wise and good,
when she discerns how much he excels
the rest of his noble Sex; the less he requires,
the more will he merit that
Esteem and Deference, which those who
are so forward to exact, seem conscious
they don’t deserve. So then the Man’s
Prerogative is not at all infring’d, whilst
the Woman’s Privileges are secured; and
if any Woman think her self injur’d,
she has a Remedy in reserve, which few
Men will envy, or endeavour to rob her
of, the Exercise and Improvement of
her Vertue Here, and the Reward of it
Hereafter.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>When I made these Reflections, I
was of Opinion, that the Case of married
Women, in comparison of that of their
Husbands, was not a little hard and unequal.
But as the World now goes, I
am apt to think, that a Husband is in
no desirable Situation; his Honour is in
his Wife’s keeping, and what Man of
Honour can be satisfied with the Conduct
which the Licentiousness of the Age
not only permits, but would endeavour
to authorize as a Part of good Breeding?
And what makes his Case the worse, he
must dissemble his Uneasiness, stifle his
Resentments, and not dare to take the
proper Methods of preventing and curing
the Disorder.</p>

<p class='c003'>So great is our Corruption, that such
as pretend to make a true Estimate of
Human Life, and very freely Satirize
both Sexes for lesser Crimes, are not
asham’d to recommend this, prescribing
a known Sin as a Cure for what is not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>absolutely unlawful in it self, though
very pernicious in its Consequences, when
carried to Excess.</p>

<p class='c003'>Not that I would in any manner apologize
for Gaming, which, when carried to
Excess, is ruinous to both Sexes, especially
to Women; who, when given to this
Vice, disregard their Husbands, and Oeconomy,
neglect the Education of their
Children, spend their Fortunes as much
as they can, and, which is not the least
Inconveniency, when they lose to Men
more than they are able to pay, they
give their Creditor Opportunity to make
insolent Demands. But sure, any Husband,
who is not sunk to the lowest
Degree of Infamy, had rather his Wife
should waste his Money at <i>Quadrille</i>,
than Intrigue with a <i>Colonel</i>. <i>If Sin you
must</i> (says an admirable Author, whose
Panegyricks are Satires, and his Satires
Panegyricks)</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>Can we read this excellent Advice

The <i>Reflector</i>, who hopes
<i>Reflector</i> is not bad <i>English</i>,
(now <i>Governor</i> is happily of

against Curiosity in vain: For a
certain ingenuous Gentleman, as she is
inform’d, had the Good-nature to own
these Reflections, so far, as to affirm that
he had the Original <i>MS.</i> in his Closet, a
Proof she is not able to produce; and so
to make himself responsible for all their
Faults, for which, she returns him all
due Acknowledgment. However, the
Generality being of Opinion, that a Man
would have had more Prudence and
Manners than to have Publish’d such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>unseasonable Truths, or to have betray’d
the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Arcana Imperii</span></i> of his Sex; she humbly
confesses, that the Contrivance and
Execution of this Design, which is unfortunately
accus’d of being so destructive
to the Government, (of the Men,
I mean) is intirely her own. She neither
advis’d with Friends, nor turn’d
over antient or modern Authors, nor
prudently submitted to the Correction of
such as are, or such as <i>think</i> they are
good Judges, but with an <i>English</i> Spirit
and Genius, set out upon the Forlorn
Hope, meaning no Hurt to any body,
nor designing any thing but the publick
Good, and to retrieve, if possible, the
Native Liberty, the Rights and Privileges
of the Subject.</p>

<p class='c003'>Far be it from her to stir up Sedition
of any sort: none can abhor it more;
and she heartily wishes, that our Masters
would pay their Civil and Ecclesiastical
Governors the same Submission, which
they themselves exact from their Domestick
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>Subjects. Nor can she imagine
how she any way undermines the Masculine
Empire, or blows the Trumpet
of Rebellion to the Moiety of Mankind.
Is it by exhorting Women, not to expect
to have their own Will in any
thing, but to be intirely Submissive,
when once they have made Choice of a
Lord and Master, though he happen
not to be so wise, so kind, or even so
just a Governor as was expected? She
did not, indeed, advise them to think
his Folly Wisdom, nor his Brutality,
that Love and Worship he promised
in his Matrimonial Oath; for this required
a Flight of Wit and Sense much
above her poor Ability, and proper only
to Masculine Understandings. However,
she did not in any manner prompt them
to Resist, or to Abdicate the Perjur’d
Spouse, though the Laws of <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>God</span></em>, and
the Land, make Special Provision for it,
in a Case, wherein, as is to be fear’d,
few Men can truly plead Not Guilty.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>’Tis true, through want of Learning,
and of that Superior Genius which
Men, as Men, lay claim to, she was ignorant
of the <i>Natural Inferiority</i> of our Sex,
which our Masters lay down as a Self-evident
and Fundamental Truth. She
saw nothing in the Reason of Things,
to make this either a Principle or a Conclusion,
but much to the contrary; it
being Sedition at least, if not Treason, to
assert it in this Reign. For if by the
Natural Superiority of their Sex, they
mean, that <i>every</i> Man is by Nature superior
to <i>every</i> Woman, which is the obvious
Meaning, and that which must be
stuck to if they would speak Sense, it
would be a Sin in <i>any</i> Woman, to have
Dominion over <i>any</i> Man, and the greatest
Queen ought not to command, but
to obey, her Footman: because no Municipal
Laws can supersede or change
the Law of Nature: So that if the Dominion
of the Men be such, the <i>Salique
Law</i>, as unjust as <i>English Men</i> have ever
thought it, ought to take Place over all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>the Earth, and the most glorious Reigns
in the <i>English</i>, <i>Danish</i>, <i>Castilian</i>, and
other Annals, were wicked Violations
of the Law of Nature!</p>

<p class='c003'>If they mean that <i>some</i> Men are superior
to <i>some</i> Women, this is no great
Discovery; had they turn’d the Tables,
they might have seen that <i>some</i> Women
are superior to <i>some</i> Men. Or had they
been pleased to remember their Oaths of
Allegiance and Supremacy, they might
have known, that <i>One</i> Woman is superior
to <i>All</i> the Men in these Nations, or
else they have sworn to very little Purpose.
And it must not be suppos’d,
that their Reason and Religion would
suffer them to take Oaths, contrary to
the Law of Nature and Reason of
Things.</p>

<p class='c003'>By all which it appears, that our Reflector’s
Ignorance is very pitiable; it
may be her Misfortune, but not her
Crime, especially since she is willing to
be better inform’d, and hopes she shall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>never be so obstinate as to shut her Eyes
against the Light of Truth, which is not
to be charg’d with Novelty, how late
soever we may be bless’d with the Discovery.
Nor can Error, be it as antient
as it may, ever plead Prescription
against Truth. And since the only way
to remove all Doubts, to answer all Objections,
and to give the Mind entire
Satisfaction, is not by <i>Affirming</i>, but by
<i>Proving</i>, so that every one may see with
their <i>own</i> Eyes, and judge according to
the best of their <i>own</i> Understandings;
she hopes it is no Presumption to insist
on this Natural Right of Judging for
her self, and the rather, because by
quitting it, we give up all the Means of
Rational Conviction. Allow us then as
many Glasses as you please to help our
Sight, and as many good Arguments as
you can afford to convince our Understandings:
But don’t exact of us, we beseech
you, to affirm that we see such
Things as are only the Discovery of Men
who have quicker Senses; or, that we
understand, and know what we have by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>Hear-say only; for to be so excessively
Complaisant, is neither to see nor to understand.</p>

<p class='c003'>That the Custom of the World, has
put Women, generally speaking, into a
State of Subjection, is not denied; but
the Right can no more be prov’d from
the Fact, than the Predominancy of Vice
can justify it. A certain great Man, has
endeavour’d to prove, by Reasons not
contemptible, that in the Original State
of Things the Woman was the Superior,
and that her Subjection to the Man is an
Effect of the Fall, and the Punishment
of her Sin: And, that ingenious Theorist
Mr. <i>Whiston</i>, asserts, That before
the Fall there was a greater Equality
between the two Sexes. However this
be, ’tis certainly no Arrogance in a Woman
to conclude, that she was made for
the Service of <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>God</span></em>, and that this is her
End. Because <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>God</span></em> made all Things
for Himself, and a rational Mind is too
noble a Being to be made for the Sake
and Service of any Creature. The Service
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>she at any Time becomes oblig’d to
pay to a Man, is only a Business by the
Bye, just as it may be any Man’s Business
and Duty to keep Hogs; he was not Made
for this, but if he Hires himself out to
such an Employment, he ought conscientiously
to perform it. Nor can any
thing be concluded to the contrary from
St. <i>Paul</i>’s Argument, 1 <i>Cor.</i> xi. for he
argues only for Decency and Order, according
to the present Custom and State
of Things: Taking his Words strictly
and literally, they prove too much, in
that, <i>Praying and Prophecying in the
Church</i> are allow’d the Women, provided
they do it with their Head cover’d
as well as the Men; and no Inequality
can be inferr’d from hence, neither from
the Gradation the Apostle there uses, that
<i>the Head of every Man is Christ, and that
the Head of the Woman is the Man, and
the Head of Christ is</i> <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>God</span></em>; it being evident
from the Form of Baptism, that
there is no natural Inferiority among the
Divine Persons, but that they are in all
Things Coequal. The Apostle, indeed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>adds, that <i>the Man is the Glory of</i> <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>God</span></em>,
<i>and the Woman the Glory of the Man</i>,
<i>&amp;c.</i> But what does he infer from hence?
He says not a Word of Inequality, or
natural Inferiority; but concludes, that
a Woman ought to cover her Head, and
a Man ought not to cover his, and <i>that
even Nature it self teaches</i> us, that <i>if a
Man have long Hair it is a Shame unto
him</i>. Whatever the Apostle’s Argument
proves in this Place, nothing can
be plainer, than that there is much more
said against the present Fashion of Mens
wearing long Hair, than for that Supremacy
they lay claim to. For by all that
appears in the Text, it is not so much a
Law of Nature, that Women should
obey Men, as that Men should not wear
long Hair. Now how can a Christian
Nation allow Fashions contrary to the
Law of Nature, forbidden by an Apostle,
and declared by him to be a Shame
to Men? Or if Custom may make an
Alteration in one Case, it may in another,
but what then becomes of the Nature
and Reason of Things? Besides, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>Conclusion the Apostle draws from his
Argument concerning Women, <i>viz.</i> that
they <i>should have Power on their Heads
because of the Angels</i>, is so very obscure
a Text, that that ingenious Paraphrast,
who pleads so much for the <i>Natural
Subjection</i> of Women, ingenuously confesses,
that he does not understand it.
Probably it refers to some Custom among
the <i>Corinthians</i>, which being well
known to them, the Apostle only hints
at it, but which we are ignorant of, and
therefore apt to mistake him. ’Tis like,
that the false Apostle whom St. <i>Paul</i>
writes against, had <i>led Captive</i> some of
their rich and powerful, but <i>silly Women</i>,
who having as mean an Opinion
of the Reason <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>God</span></em> had given them, as
any Deceiver could desire, did not, like
the noble-minded <i>Bereans, search the
Scriptures whether those things were so</i>,
but lazily took up with having Mens
Persons in admiration, and follow’d their
Leaders blindfold, the certain Rout to
Destruction. And it is also probable,
that the same cunning Seducer imploy’d
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>these Women to carry on his own Designs,
and putting them upon what he might
not think fit to appear in himself, made
them guilty of indecent Behaviour in the
Church of <i>Corinth</i>. And therefore
St. <i>Paul</i> thought it necessary to reprove
them so severely, in order to humble
them; but this being done, he takes care
in the Conclusion to set the Matter on a
right Foot, placing the two Sexes on a
Level, to keep Men, as much as might
be, from taking those Advantages which
People who have Strength in their Hands,
are apt to assume over those who can’t
contend with them. For, says he, <i>Nevertheless</i>,
or notwithstanding the former
Argument, <i>the Man is not without
the Woman, nor the Woman without the
Man, but all Things of</i> <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>God</span></em>. The Relation
between the two Sexes is mutual,
and the Dependance reciprocal, both of
them depending intirely upon <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>God</span></em>, and
upon Him only; which, one would
think, is no great Argument of the natural
Inferiority of either Sex.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>Our <i>Reflector</i> is of Opinion, that
Disputes of this kind, extending to Human
Nature in general, and not peculiar
to those to whom the Word of <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>God</span></em> has
been reveal’d, ought to be decided by
Natural Reason only. And, that the
Holy Scripture should not be interested
in the present Controversy, in which it
determines nothing, any more than it
does between the <i>Copernican</i> and <i>Ptolomean</i>
Systems. The Design of those
Holy Books being to make us excellent
Moralists and perfect Christians, not
great Philosophers; and being writ for
the Vulgar as well as for the Learned,
they are accommodated to the common
way of Speech and the Usage of the
World; in which we have but a short
Probation, so that it matters not much
what Part we act, whether of Governing
or Obeying, provided we perform it
well with respect to the World to come.</p>

<p class='c003'>One does not wonder, indeed, that
when an Adversary is drove to a Nonplus,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>and Reason declares against him,
he flies to Authority, especially to Divine,
which is infallible, and therefore
ought not to be disputed. But Scripture
is not always on their Side who make
Parade of it, and through their Skill in
Languages, and the Tricks of the
Schools, wrest it from its genuine Sense
to their own Inventions. And supposing,
not granting, that it were apparently
to the Womens Disadvantage, no
fair and generous Adversary but would
be asham’d to urge this Advantage: Because
Women, without their own Fault,
are kept in Ignorance of the Original,
wanting Languages and other Helps to
Criticise on the Sacred Text, of which,
they know no more, than Men are
pleas’d to impart in their Translations.
In short, they shew their Desire to maintain
their Hypotheses, but by no means
their Reverence to the Sacred Oracles,
who engage them in such Disputes.
And therefore, the Blame be theirs, who
have unnecessarily introduc’d them in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>the present Subject, and who, by saying,
that the <i>Reflections</i> were not agreeable
to Scripture, oblige the Reflector to shew,
that those who affirm it must either mistake
her Meaning, or the Sense of Holy
Scripture, or both, if they think what
they say, and do not find fault meerly
because they resolve to do so. For, had
she ever writ any thing contrary to those
sacred Truths, she would be the first in
pronouncing its Condemnation.</p>

<p class='c003'>But what says the Holy Scripture?
It speaks of Women as in a State of Subjection,
and so it does of the <i>Jews</i> and
<i>Christians</i>, when under the Dominion of
the <i>Chaldeans</i> and <i>Romans</i>, requiring of
the one as well as of the other, a quiet
Submission to them under whose Power
they liv’d. But will any one say, that
these had a <i>Natural Superiority</i> and Right
to Dominion? that they had a superior
Understanding, or any Pre-eminence,
except what their greater Strength acquir’d?
Or, that the other were subjected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>to their Adversaries for any other
Reason but the Punishment of their Sins,
and, in order to their Reformation? Or
for the Exercise of their Vertue, and because
the Order of the World and the
Good of Society requir’d it?</p>

<p class='c003'>If Mankind had never Sin’d, Reason
would always have been obeyed, there
would have been no Struggle for Dominion,
and Brutal Power would not have
prevail’d. But in the lapsed State of
Mankind, and now, that Men will not
be guided by their Reason but by their
Appetites, and do not what they <i>ought</i>
but what they <i>can</i>, the Reason, or that
which stands for it, the Will and Pleasure
of the Governor, is to be the Reason
of those who will not be guided by their
own, and must take Place for Order’s
sake, although it should not be conformable
to right Reason. Nor can there be
any Society great or little, from Empires
down to private Families, without
a last Resort, to determine the Affairs of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>that Society by an irresistable Sentence.
Now unless this Supremacy be fix’d
somewhere, there will be a perpetual
Contention about it, such is the Love of
Dominion, and let the Reason of Things
be what it may, those who have least
Force or Cunning to supply it, will have
the Disadvantage. So that since Women
are acknowledged to have least Bodily
Strength, their being commanded to
Obey is in pure Kindness to them, and
for their Quiet and Security, as well as
for the Exercise of their Vertue. But
does it follow, that Domestick Governors
have more Sense than their Subjects,
any more than that other Governors
have? We do not find that any Man
thinks the worse of his own Understanding,
because another has superior Power;
or concludes himself less capable of a
Post of Honour and Authority, because
he is not prefer’d to it. How much
Time would lie on Mens Hands, how
empty would the Places of Concourse
be, and how silent most Companies, did
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>Men forbear to censure their Governors,
that is, in effect, to think themselves
wiser. Indeed, Government would be
much more desirable than it is, did it invest
the Possessor with a superior Understanding
as well as Power. And if meer
Power gives a Right to Rule, there can
be no such Thing as Usurpation; but a
Highway-Man, so long as he has Strength
to force, has also a Right to require our
Obedience.</p>

<p class='c003'>Again, if absolute Sovereignty be
not necessary in a State, how comes it
to be so in a Family? Or if in a Family
why not in a State; since no Reason
can be alledged for the one that will not
hold more strongly for the other? If the
Authority of the Husband, so far as it
extends, is sacred and inalienable, why
not that of the Prince? The Domestick
Sovereign is without Dispute elected, and
the Stipulations and Contract are mutual;
is it not then partial in Men to the last
Degree, to contend for, and practise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>that Arbitrary Dominion in their Families,
which they abhor and exclaim
against in the State? For if Arbitrary
Power is evil in it self, and an improper
Method of Governing Rational and Free
Agents, it ought not to be practis’d any
where; nor is it less, but rather more
mischievous in Families than in Kingdoms,
by how much 100,000 Tyrants
are worse than one. What though a
Husband can’t deprive a Wife of Life
without being responsible to the Law, he
may, however, do what is much more
grievous to a generous Mind, render Life
miserable, for which she has no Redress,
scarce Pity, which is afforded to every
other Complainant, it being thought a
Wife’s Duty to suffer every thing without
Complaint. If <i>all Men are born
Free</i>, how is it that all Women are born
Slaves? As they must be, if the being
subjected to the <i>inconstant, uncertain, unknown,
arbitrary Will</i> of Men, be the
<i>perfect Condition of Slavery</i>? And, if the
Essence of Freedom consists, as our Masters
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>say it does, in having a <i>standing
Rule to live by</i>? And why is Slavery so
much condemn’d and strove against in
one Case, and so highly applauded, and
held so necessary and so sacred in another?</p>

<p class='c003'>’Tis true, that <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>God</span></em> told <i>Eve</i> after
the Fall, that <i>her Husband should Rule
over her</i>: And so it is, that he told <i>Esau</i>
by the Mouth of <i>Isaac</i> his Father, that
he should <i>serve</i> his <i>younger Brother</i>, and
should in Time, and when he was strong
enough to do it, <i>break the Yoke from off
his Neck</i>. Now, why one Text should
be a Command any more than the other,
and not both of them be Predictions only;
or why the former should prove
<i>Adam</i>’s Natural Right to Rule, and
much less every Man’s, any more than
the latter is a Proof of <i>Jacob</i>’s Right to
Rule, and of <i>Esau</i>’s to Rebel, one is yet
to learn? The Text in both Cases foretelling
what would be; but neither of
them determining what <i>ought</i> to be.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>But the Scripture commands <i>Wives</i>
to <i>submit themselves to their own Husbands</i>.
True; for which St. <i>Paul</i> gives
a Mystical Reason (<i>Eph.</i> v. 22, <i>&amp;c.</i>)
and St. <i>Peter</i>, a Prudential and Charitable
one (1 <i>Pet.</i> iii.) but neither of them
derive that Subjection from the Law of
Nature. Nay, St. <i>Paul</i>, as if he foresaw
and meant to prevent this Plea, giving
Directions for their Conduct to Women
in general, 1 <i>Tim.</i> ii. when he comes
to speak of <i>Subjection</i>, he changes his
Phrase from <i>Women</i>, which denotes the
whole Sex, to <i>Woman</i>, which in the
New Testament is appropriated to a
Wife.</p>

<p class='c003'>As for his not suffering Women to
speak in the Church, no sober Person
that I know of pretends to it. That
learned Paraphrast, indeed, who lays
so much Stress on the <i>Natural Subjection</i>,
provided this Prerogative be secur’d, is
willing to give up the other. For he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>endeavours to prove, that Inspir’d Women,
as well as Men, us’d to speak in
the Church, and that St. <i>Paul</i> does not
forbid it, but only takes care that the
Women should signify their Subjection
by wearing a Veil. But the Apostle is
his own best Expositor, let us therefore
compare his Precepts with his Practice,
for he was all of a Piece, and did not
contradict himself. Now by this Comparison
we find, that though he forbids
Women to teach in the Church, and this
for several Prudential Reasons, like those
he introduces with an <i>I give my Opinion,
and now speak I, not the Lord</i>, and not
because of any Law of Nature, or positive
Divine Precept, for that the Words
<i>they are commanded</i> (1 <i>Cor.</i> xiv. 24.) are
not in the Original, appears from the
<i>Italick</i> Character, yet he did not found
this Prohibition on any suppos’d want of
Understanding in Woman, or of Ability
to teach; neither does he confine them
at all Times to <i>learn in Silence</i>. For the
eloquent <i>Apollos</i>, who was himself a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>Teacher, was instructed by <i>Priscilla</i>, as
well as by her Husband <i>Aquila</i>, and was
improv’d by them both in the Christian
Faith. Nor does St. <i>Paul</i> blame her for
this, or suppose that she <i>usurp’d Authority
over</i> that great <i>Man</i>; so far from
this, that as she is always honourably
mention’d in Holy Scripture, so our
Apostle, in his Salutations, <i>Rom.</i> xvi.
places her in the Front, even before her
Husband, giving to her, as well as to
him, the Noble Title of, <i>his Helper in
Christ Jesus</i>, and of one <i>to whom all
the Churches of the</i> Gentiles had great
Obligations.</p>

<p class='c003'>But, it will be said perhaps, that in
1 <i>Tim.</i> ii. 13, <i>&amp;c.</i> St. <i>Paul</i> argues for
the Woman’s Subjection from the Reason
of Things. To this I answer, that
it must be confess’d, that this (according
to the vulgar Interpretation) is a
very obscure Place, and I should be glad
to see a Natural, and not a Forc’d Interpretation
given of it by those who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>take it Literally: Whereas if it be taken
Allegorically, with respect to the Mystical
Union between Christ and his Church,
to which St. <i>Paul</i> frequently accommodates
the Matrimonial Relation, the Difficulties
vanish. For the Earthly <i>Adam</i>’s
being <i>form’d</i> before <i>Eve</i>, seems as little
to prove her Natural Subjection to him,
as the living Creatures, Fishes, Birds
and Beasts being form’d before them
both, proves that Mankind must be subject
to these Animals. Nor can the
Apostle mean that <i>Eve</i> only sinned; or
that she only was <i>Deceiv’d</i>, for if <i>Adam</i>
sinn’d wilfully and knowingly, he became
the greater Transgressor. But it
is very true, that the Second <i>Adam</i>, the
Man Christ Jesus, <i>was first form’d</i>, and
then his Spouse the Church. He was
not in any respect <i>Deceiv’d</i>, nor does
she pretend to Infallibility. And from
this second <i>Adam</i>, promis’d to <i>Eve</i> in
the Day of our first Parents Transgression,
and from Him only, do all their
Race, Men as well as Women, derive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>their Hopes of Salvation. Nor is it promis’d
to either Sex on any other Terms
besides Perseverance in <i>Faith, Charity,
Holiness and Sobriety</i>.</p>

<p class='c003'>If the Learned will not admit of this
Interpretation, I know not how to contend
with them. For Sense is a Portion
that <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>God</span></em> Himself has been pleased to
distribute to both Sexes with an impartial
Hand, but Learning is what Men
have engross’d to themselves, and one
can’t but admire their great Improvements!
For, after doubting whether
there was such a Thing as Truth, and
after many hundred Years Disputes about
it, in the last Century an extraordinary
Genius arose, (whom yet, some are
pleased to call a Visionary) enquir’d
after it, and laid down the best Method
of finding it. Not to the general Liking
of the Men of Letters, perhaps,
because it was wrote in a vulgar Language,
and was so natural and easy as to
debase Truth to common Understandings,
shewing too plainly, that Learning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>and true Knowledge are two very
different Things. “For it often happens
(says that Author) that Women
and Children acknowledge the Falsehood
of those Prejudices we contend
with, because they do not dare to
judge without Examination, and they
bring all the Attention they are capable
of to what they read. Whereas
on the contrary, the Learned continue
wedded to their own Opinions,
because they will not take the Trouble
of examining what is contrary to
their receiv’d Doctrines.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Sciences, indeed, have been invented
and taught long ago, and, as
Men grew better advis’d, new modelled.
So that it is become a considerable Piece
of Learning to give an Account of the
Rise and Progress of the Sciences, and
of the various Opinions of Men concerning
them. But Certainty and Demonstration
are much pretended to in this
present Age, and being obtain’d in many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>Things, ’tis hoped Men will never Dispute
them away in that which is of greatest
Importance, the Way of Salvation.
And because there is not any thing more
certain than what is delivered in the
Oracles of <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>God</span></em>, we come now to consider
what they offer in Favour of our
Sex.</p>

<p class='c003'>Let it be premis’d, (according to
the Reasoning of a very ingenious Person
in a like Case) that one Text for us,
is more to be regarded than many against
us. Because that <i>One</i> being different
from what Custom has established, ought
to be taken with Philosophical Strictness;
whereas the <i>Many</i> being express’d according
to the vulgar Mode of Speech,
ought to have no greater Stress laid on
them, than that evident Condescension
will bear. One Place then were sufficient,
but we have many Instances
wherein Holy Scripture considers Women
very differently from what they appear
in the common Prejudices of Mankind.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>The World will hardly allow a
Woman to say any thing well, unless,
as she borrows it from Men, or as assisted
by them: But <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>God</span></em> Himself allows
that the Daughters of <i>Zelophehad spake
right</i>, and passes their Request into a
Law. Considering how much the Tyranny,
shall I say, or the superior Force
of Men, keeps Women from Acting in
the World, or doing any thing considerable,
and remembring withal the Conciseness
of the Sacred Story, no small
Part of it is bestow’d in transmitting the
History of Women, famous in their Generations:
Two of the Canonical Books,
bearing the Names of those great Women
whose Vertues and Actions are there
recorded. <i>Ruth</i> being call’d from among
the <i>Gentiles</i> to be an Ancestor of the
Messiah, and <i>Esther</i> being rais’d up by
<em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>God</span></em> to be the great Instrument of the
Deliverance and Prosperity of the <i>Jewish</i>
Church.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>The Character of <i>Isaac</i>, though one
of the most blameless Men taken Notice
of in the Old Testament, must give
Place to <i>Rebecca</i>’s, whose Affections are
more reasonably plac’d than his, her
Favourite Son being the same who was
<em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>God</span></em>’s Favourite. Nor was the Blessing
bestow’d according to his, but to her
Desire; so that if you will not allow,
that her Command to <i>Jacob</i> superseded
<i>Isaac</i>’s to <i>Esau</i>, his Desire to give the
Blessing to this Son, being evidently an
Effect of his Partiality; you must at
least grant, that she paid greater Deference
to the Divine Revelation, and for
this Reason, at least, had a Right to
oppose her Husband’s Design; which,
it seems, <i>Isaac</i> was sensible of, when
upon his Disappointment, he <i>trembled so
exceedingly</i>. And so much Notice is taken
even of <i>Rebecca</i>’s Nurse, that we
have an Account where she died, and
where she was buried.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span><em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>God</span></em> is pleas’d to Record it among
His Favours to the ingrateful <i>Jews</i>, that
He sent before them His Servants <i>Moses</i>,
<i>Aaron</i>, and <span class='sc'>Miriam</span>; who was also a
Prophetess, and instructed the Women
how to bear their Part with <i>Moses</i> in his
Triumphal Hymn. Is she to be blam’d
for her Ambition? And is not the High
Priest <i>Aaron</i> also, who has his Share
in the Reproof as well as in the Crime?
nor could she have mov’d Sedition if she
had not been a considerable Person,
which appears also by the Respect the
People paid her, in deferring their Journey
till she was ready.</p>

<p class='c003'>Where shall we find a nobler Piece
of Poetry than <i>Deborah</i>’s Song? Or a
better and greater Ruler than that renowned
Woman, whose Government so
much excell’d that of the former Judges?
And though she had a Husband, she her
self judged <i>Israel</i>, and consequently was
his Sovereign, of whom we know no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>more than the Name. Which Instance,
as I humbly suppose, overthrows the
Pretence of <i>Natural Inferiority</i>. For it
is not the bare Relation of a Fact, by
which none ought to be concluded, unless
it is conformable to a Rule, and to
the Reason of Things: But <i>Deborah</i>’s
Government was conferr’d on her by <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>God</span></em>
Himself. Consequently the Sovereignty
of a Woman is not contrary to the Law
of Nature; for the Law of Nature is
the Law of <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>God</span></em>, who cannot contradict
Himself; and yet it was <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>God</span></em> who
inspir’d and approv’d that great Woman,
raising her up to Judge and to Deliver
His People <i>Israel</i>.</p>

<p class='c003'>Not to insist on the Courage of that
valiant Woman, who deliver’d <i>Thebez</i>
by slaying the Assailant; nor upon the
Preference which <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>God</span></em> thought fit to
give to <i>Sampson</i>’s Mother, in sending the
Angel to her, and not to her Husband,
whose vulgar Fear she so prudently answer’d,
as plainly shews her superior
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>Understanding: To pass over <i>Abigail</i>’s
wise Conduct, whereby she preserv’d
her Family and deserved <i>David</i>’s Acknowledgments,
for restraining him from
doing a rash and unjustifiable Action;
the Holy Penman giving her the Character
of a <i>Woman of good Understanding</i>,
whilst her Husband has that of a Churlish
and Foolish Person, and a Son of
<i>Belial</i>: To say nothing of the <i>wise Woman</i>
(as the Text calls her) of <i>Tekoah</i>;
or of her of <i>Abel</i>, who has the same Epithet,
and who by her Prudence delivered
the City and appeas’d a dangerous
Rebellion: Nor of the Queen of <i>Sheba</i>,
whose Journey to hear the Wisdom of
<i>Solomon</i>, shews her own good Judgment
and great Share in that excellent Endowment.
<i>Solomon</i> does not think himself
too wise to be instructed by his Mother,
nor too great to record her Lessons,
which, if he had followed, he might
have spared the Trouble of Repentance,
and been delivered from a great deal of
that Vanity he so deeply regrets.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>What Reason can be assign’d why
the Mothers of the Kings of <i>Judah</i>, are
so frequently noted in those very short
Accounts that are given of their Reigns,
but the great Respect paid them, or
perhaps their Influence on the Government,
and Share in the Administration?
This is not improbable, since the wicked
<i>Athaliah</i> had Power to carry on her
Intrigues so far as to get Possession of the
Throne, and to keep it for some Years.
Neither was there any Necessity for <i>Asa</i>’s
removing his Mother (or Grandmother)
from being Queen, if this were merely
Titular, and did not carry Power and
Authority along with it. And we find
what Influence <i>Jezabel</i> had in <i>Israel</i>, indeed
to her Husband’s and her own Destruction.</p>

<p class='c003'>It was a <i>Widow-Woman</i> whom <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>God</span></em>
made choice of to sustain his Prophet
<i>Elijah</i> at <i>Zarephah</i>. And the History
of the <i>Shunamite</i> is a noble Instance of
the Account that is made of Women in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>Holy Scripture. For whether it was not
the Custom in <i>Shunem</i> for the Husband
to dictate, or whether her’s was conscious
of her superior Vertue, or whatever
was the Reason, we find it is she
who governs, <i>dwelling</i> with great Honour
and Satisfaction <i>among her own People</i>.
Which Happiness she understood
so well, and was so far from a troublesome
Ambition, that she desires no Recommendation
to <i>the King or Captain of
the Host</i>, when the Prophet offer’d it,
being already greater than they could
make her. The Text calls her a <i>Great
Woman</i>, whilst her Husband is hardly
taken Notice of, and this, no otherwise,
than as performing the Office of a
Bailiff. It is <i>her</i> Piety and Hospitality
that are Recorded, <i>She</i> invites the Prophet
to <i>her House</i>; who converses with,
and is entertained by <i>her</i>. She gives
her Husband no Account of <i>her</i> Affairs
any further, than to tell him <i>her</i> Designs,
that he may see them executed. And
when he desires to know the Reason of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>her Conduct, all the Answer she affords
is, <i>Well</i>, or, as the Margin has it from
the <i>Hebrew</i>, <i>Peace</i>. Nor can this be
thought assuming, since it is no more
than what the Prophet encourages, for
all his Addresses are to <i>her</i>, he takes no
Notice of her Husband. His Benefits are
conferr’d on <i>her</i>, ’tis <i>she</i> and <i>her Household</i>
whom he warns of a Famine, and
’tis <i>she</i> who Appeals to the King for the
Restitution of <i>her House</i> and <i>Land</i>. I
would not infer from hence, that Women,
generally speaking, ought to govern
in their Families when they have
a Husband; but I think this Instance
and Example is a sufficient Proof, that
if by Custom or Contract, or the Laws
of the Country, or Birth-right, (as in
the Case of Sovereign Princesses) they
have the supreme Authority, it is no
Usurpation, nor do they act contrary to
Holy Scripture, nor consequently to
the Law of Nature. For they are no
where, that I know of, forbidden to
claim their just Right: The Apostle,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>’tis true, would not have them <i>usurp</i>
Authority, where Custom and the Law
of the strongest had brought them into
Subjection, as it has in these Parts of the
World. Though in remoter Regions,
if Travellers rightly inform us, the Succession
to the Crown is intail’d on the
Female Line.</p>

<p class='c003'><em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>God</span></em> Himself, who is <i>no Respecter of
Persons, with whom there is neither Bond
nor Free, Male nor Female, but</i> they <i>are
all one in Christ Jesus</i>, did not deny
Women that Divine Gift the Spirit of
Prophecy, neither under the <i>Jewish</i> nor
Christian Dispensation. We have nam’d
two great Prophetesses already, <i>Miriam</i>
and <i>Deborah</i>; and besides other Instances,
<i>Huldah</i> the Prophetess was such an
Oracle, that the good King <i>Josiah</i>, that
great Pattern of Vertue, sends even the
High Priest himself to consult her, and
to receive Directions from her in the
most arduous Affairs. <i>It shall come to
pass</i>, saith the Lord, <i>that I will pour out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>my Spirit upon all Flesh, and your Sons and
your Daughters shall Prophesy</i>, which
was accordingly fulfill’d by the Mission
of the Holy <i>Ghost</i> on the Day of <i>Pentecost</i>,
as St. <i>Peter</i> tells us. And, besides
others, there is mention of four Daughters
of <i>Philip</i>, Virgins, who did Prophesy.
For, as in the <i>Old</i>, so in the <i>New Testament</i>,
Women make a considerable Figure;
the Holy Virgin receiving the
greatest Honour that Human Nature is
capable of, when the Son of <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>God</span></em> vouchsafed
to be her Son, and to derive his
Humanity from her only. And if it is
a greater Blessing <i>to hear the Word of</i>
<em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>God</span></em> <i>and keep it</i>, who are more considerable
for their Assiduity in this, than the
Female Disciples of our <span class='sc'>Lord</span>? <i>Mary</i>
being Exemplary, and receiving a noble
Encomium from Him, for her Choice of
the better Part.</p>

<p class='c003'>It would be thought tedious to enumerate
all the excellent Women mentioned
in the <i>New Testament</i>, whose humble
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>Penitence and ardent Love, as <i>Magdalen</i>’s;
their lively Faith and holy Importunity,
as the <i>Syrophenician</i>’s; extraordinary
Piety and Uprightness, as <i>Elizabeth</i>’s;
Hospitality, Charity and Diligence,
as <i>Martha</i>’s, <i>Tabitha</i>’s, <i>&amp;c.</i> (see
St. <i>Luke</i> viii.); frequent and assiduous Devotions
and Austerities, as <i>Anna</i>’s; Constancy
and Courage, Perseverance and
ardent Zeal, as that of the Holy Women
who attended our <span class='sc'>Lord</span> to His
Cross, when His Disciples generally forsook,
and the most Courageous had denied
Him; are Recorded for our Example.
Their Love was stronger than
Death, it followed our Saviour into the
Grave. And, as a Reward, both the
Angel, and even the <span class='sc'>Lord</span> Himself,
appears first to them, and sends them to
preach the great Article of the Resurrection
to the very Apostles, who being,
as yet, under the Power of the Prejudices
of their Sex, esteem’d the Holy Womens
<i>Words as idle Tales, and believed them
not</i>.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>Some Men will have it, that the
Reason of our <span class='sc'>Lord</span>’s appearing first
to the Women, was, their being least
able to keep a Secret; a witty and masculine
Remark, and wonderfully Reverent!
But not to dispute whether those
Women were Blabs or no, there are many
Instances in Holy Scripture, of Women
who did not betray the Confidence repos’d
in them. Thus <i>Rahab</i>, though
formerly an ill Woman, being converted
by the <i>Report</i> of those Miracles, which,
though the <i>Israelites saw</i>, yet they <i>believed
not in</i> <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>God</span></em>, <i>nor put their Trust in
his Word</i>, She acknowledges the <em class='gesperrt'><span class='sc'>God</span></em> of
Heaven, and, as a Reward of her faithful
Service, in concealing <i>Joshua</i>’s Spies,
is, with her Family, exempted from the
Ruin of her Country, and also, has the
Honour of being named in the <i>Messiah</i>’s
Genealogy. <i>Michal</i>, to save <i>David</i>’s
Life, exposes her self to the Fury of a
Jealous and Tyrannical Prince. A Girl
was trusted by <i>David</i>’s grave Counsellors
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>to convey him Intelligence in his
Son’s Rebellion; and when a Lad had
found it out, and blab’d it to <i>Absalom</i>,
the King’s Friends confiding in the Prudence
and Fidelity of a Woman, were
secur’d by her. When our <span class='sc'>Lord</span> escaped
from the <i>Jews</i>, he trusted Himself
in the Hands of <i>Martha</i> and <i>Mary</i>. So
does St. <i>Peter</i> with another <i>Mary</i>, when
the Angel deliver’d him from <i>Herod</i>, the
Damsel <i>Rhoda</i> too, was acquainted with
the Secret. More might be said, but one
would think here is enough to shew,
that whatever other great and wise Reasons
Men may have for despising Women,
and keeping them in Ignorance
and Slavery, it can’t be from their having
learnt to do so in Holy Scripture. The
Bible is for, and not against us, and cannot
without great Violence done to it,
be urg’d to our Prejudice.</p>

<p class='c003'>However, there are strong and
prevalent Reasons which demonstrate the
Superiority and Pre-eminence of the Men.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>For in the first Place, Boys have much
Time and Pains, Care and Cost bestow’d
on their Education, Girls have little or
none. The former are early initiated in
the Sciences, are made acquainted with
antient and modern Discoveries, they
study Books and Men, have all imaginable
Encouragement; not only Fame,
a dry Reward now a-days, but also
Title, Authority, Power, and Riches
themselves, which purchase all Things,
are the Reward of their Improvement.
The latter are restrain’d, frown’d upon,
and beat, not <i>for</i>, but <i>from</i> the Muses;
Laughter and Ridicule, that never-failing
Scare-Crow, is set up to drive them
from the Tree of Knowledge. But if,
in spite of all Difficulties Nature prevails,
and they can’t be kept so ignorant as
their Masters would have them, they are
star’d upon as Monsters, censur’d, envied,
and every way discouraged, or, at
the best, they have the Fate the Proverb
assigns them, <i>Vertue is prais’d and
starv’d</i>. And therefore, since the coarsest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>Materials need the most Curing, as
every Workman can inform you, and
the worst Ground the most elaborate Culture,
it undeniably follows, that Mens
Understandings are superior to Womens,
for, after many Years Study and Experience,
they become wise and learned,
and Women are not Born so!</p>

<p class='c003'>Again, Men are possessed of all
Places of Power, Trust and Profit, they
make Laws and exercise the Magistracy,
not only the sharpest Sword, but even
all the Swords and Blunderbusses are
theirs, which by the strongest Logick in
the World, gives them the best Title to
every Thing they please to claim as their
Prerogative: Who shall contend with
them? Immemorial Prescription is on
their Side in these Parts of the World,
antient Tradition and modern Usage!
Our Fathers, have all along, both taught
and practised Superiority over the weaker
Sex, and consequently Women are by
Nature inferior to Men, as was to be demonstrated.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>An Argument which must
be acknowledged unanswerable; for, as
well as I love my Sex, I will not pretend
a Reply to <i>such</i> Demonstration!</p>

<p class='c003'>Only let me beg to be inform’d, to
whom we poor Fatherless Maids, and
Widows who have lost their Masters,
owe Subjection? It can’t be to all Men
in general, unless all Men were agreed
to give the same Commands; Do we
then fall as Strays, to the first who finds
us? By the Maxims of some Men, and
the Conduct of some Women one would
think so. But whoever he be that thus
happens to become our Master, if he allows
us to be reasonable Creatures, and
does not meerly Compliment us with
that Title, since no Man denies our Readiness
to use our Tongues, it would
tend, I should think, to our Master’s
Advantage, and therefore he may please
to be advis’d to teach us to improve our
Reason. But if Reason is only allow’d
us by way of Raillery, and the secret
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>Maxim is, that we have none, or little
more than Brutes, ’tis the best way to
confine us with Chain and Block to the
Chimney-Corner, which, probably, might
save the Estates of some Families and
the Honour of others.</p>

<p class='c003'>I Do not propose this to prevent a
Rebellion, for Women are not so well
united as to form an Insurrection. They
are for the most part wise enough to love
their Chains, and to discern how very
becomingly they fit. They think as
humbly of themselves as their Masters
can wish, with respect to the other Sex,
but in regard to their own, they have a
Spice of Masculine Ambition; every one
would Lead, and none would Follow.
Both Sexes being too apt to Envy, and
too backward in Emulating, and take
more Delight in detracting from their
Neighbour’s Vertue, than in improving
their own. And therefore, as to those
Women who find themselves born for
Slavery, and are so sensible of their own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>Meanness, as to conclude it impossible to
attain to any thing excellent, since they
are, or ought to be best acquainted with
their own Strength and Genius, She’s a
Fool who would attempt their Deliverance
or Improvement. No, let them
enjoy the great Honour and Felicity of
their tame, submissive and depending
Temper! Let the Men applaud, and let
them glory in this wonderful Humility!
Let them receive the Flatteries and Grimaces
of the other Sex, live unenvied by
their own, and be as much belov’d as
one such Woman can afford to love another!
Let them enjoy the Glory of
treading in the Footsteps of their Predecessors,
and of having the Prudence to
avoid that audacious Attempt of soaring
beyond their Sphere! Let them Huswife
or Play, Dress, and be pretty entertaining
Company! Or, which is better,
relieve the Poor to ease their own
Compassions, read pious Books, say their
Prayers, and go to Church, because they
have been taught and us’d to do so,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>without being able to give a better Reason
for their Faith and Practice! Let
them not by any means aspire at being
Women of Understanding, because no
Man can endure a Woman of Superior
Sense, or would treat a reasonable Woman
civilly, but that he thinks he stands
on higher Ground, and, that she is so
wise as to make Exceptions in his Favour,
and to take her Measures by his
Directions; they may pretend to Sense,
indeed, since meer Pretences only render
one the more ridiculous! Let them, in
short, be what is call’d <i>very</i> Women,
for this is most acceptable to all sorts of
Men; or let them aim at the Title of
<i>good devout</i> Women, since some Men can
bear with this; but let them not judge
of the Sex by their own Scantling: For
the great Author of Nature and Fountain
of all Perfection, never design’d
that the Mean and Imperfect, but that
the most Compleat and Excellent of His
Creatures in every Kind, should be the
Standard to the rest.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>To conclude; If that <span class='sc'>Great Queen</span>
who has subdued the Proud, and made
the pretended Invincible more than once
fly before her; who has Rescued an Empire,
Reduced a Kingdom, Conquer’d
Provinces in as little Time almost as one
can Travel them, and seems to have
chain’d Victory to her Standard; who
disposes of Crowns, gives Laws and
Liberty to <i>Europe</i>, and is the chief Instrument
in the Hand of the Almighty,
to pull down and to set up the great
Men of the Earth; who conquers every
where for others, and no where for her
self but in the Hearts of the Conquer’d,
who are of the Number of those who
reap the Benefit of her Triumphs; whilst
she only reaps for her self the Lawrels
of disinterested Glory, and the Royal
Pleasure of doing Heroically; if this
Glory of her own Sex, and Envy of
the other, will not think we need, or
does not hold us worthy of, the Protection
of her ever victorious Arms, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>Men have not the Gratitude, for her sake
at least, to do Justice to her Sex, who
has been such a universal Benefactress to
theirs: Adieu to the Liberties, not of
this or that Nation or Region only, but
of the Moiety of Mankind! To all the
great Things that Women might perform,
inspir’d by her Example, encouraged
by her Smiles, and supported by
her Power! To their Discovery of new
Worlds for the Exercise of her Goodness,
new Sciences to publish her Fame,
and reducing Nature it self to a Subjection
to her Empire! To their destroying
those worst of Tyrants Impiety and
Immorality, which dare to stalk about
even in her own Dominions, and to devour
Souls almost within View of her
Throne, leaving a Stench behind them
scarce to be corrected even by the Incense
of her Devotions! To the Women’s
tracing a new Path to Honour,
in which none shall walk but such as
scorn to Cringe in order to Rise, and
who are Proof both against giving and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>receiving Flattery! In a Word, to those
Halcyon, or, if you will, <i>Millennium</i>
Days, in which the Wolf and the Lamb
shall feed together, and a Tyrannous
Domination, which Nature never meant,
shall no longer render useless, if not
hurtful, the Industry and Understandings
of half Mankind!</p>
